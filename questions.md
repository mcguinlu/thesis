It would be very rare to start someone on 2 drugs at the same time.

The flowchart for defining dementia diagnoses seems to ignore the ordering. So if the initial diagnosis was VaD but later it was changed to AD it is coded as “Other dementia” but actual evidence might have switched it to AD. This can be criticized.

Was age considered as a continuous variable e.g. 65.8 years? Did you check for linear assumption and look at either age grouped or polynomial?

Not sure I follow this. Are you assuming that as the diagnosis of AD has become more popular there would not only be an increase in frequency but I shift towards more probable or perhaps more possible if lower threshold. Please clarify. - _Thinking is that_

Did you formally test for heterogeneity between lipophilic and hydrophilic statins?

Why did you not use a trial emulation analysis? See emails for reasons to justify

Would confounding effect of ApoE4 not be somewhat moderated by adjusting for LDL-c 

Increased risk of AD with fibrates? Not consistent across AD outcomes like exetimibe is across  vascular/other
