It would be very rare to start someone on 2 drugs at the same time.

Less clear why chronic illness would predict statin use

The flowchart for defining dementia diagnoses seems to ignore the ordering. So if the initial diagnosis was VaD but later it was changed to AD it is coded as “Other dementia” but actual evidence might have switched it to AD. This can be criticized.

Was age considered as a continuous variable e.g. 65.8 years? Did you check for linear assumption and look at either age grouped or polynomial?

Not sure I follow this. Are you assuming that as the diagnosis of AD has become more popular there would not only be an increase in frequency but I shift towards more probable or perhaps more possible if lower threshold. Please clarify. - _Thinking is that_

Did you formally test for heterogeneity between lipophilic and hydrophilic statins?

Why did you not use a trial emulation analysis? See emails for reasons to justify.

Would confounding effect of ApoE4 not be somewhat moderated by adjusting for LDL-c? 

Increased risk of AD with fibrates? Not consistent across AD outcomes like ezetimibe is across vascular/other

Which method did you use for random effects meta-analysis and why?

Why is the dose response model multi-variate? Accounts for results and the correlation between results.

What is the purpose of using knots?

Talk about problems with including Hippsley-Cox re double-counting?

wHY OKAY TO INCLUDE ehr WHEN NOT USING CRITERIA? nOT COLLECTED FOR REASEARCH AND SO POTENTIALLY LESS LIKELY TO HAVE DIFFERENTIAL MISCLASSIFICATION

Why is the std error of LDL much wider than others? Needed to be calculated from the imputed values of TC, HDL and TG, and so more variability across the different datasets.

What are unique contributions above and beyond Becky's work? A priori assignment of bias distributions, using of cutting edge tools to assess bias and mapping of answers to additive/proportional biases, new visualisations of bias, multiple sources of evidence, broader definition of indirect (e.g. using statins as a source of evidence on an exposure).

There are limitations to including preprints - discuss?

Why not use a multivariate approach, given co-dependence of all lipid fractions?
