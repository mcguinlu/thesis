__Abstract__
The abstract is not currently standing on its own.
- [ ] The rationale is not very clear. What was the existing evidence before the study/thesis? Previous evidence of associations and causal effects? Are there uncertainties?
- [ ] Report results of the association between triglycerides and vascular dementia 
- [ ] Report results of systematic review of MR studies
- [ ] Results of your CPRD analysis are not consistent with that in the main text. Please revise

__Chapter 1__
- [ ]	The section on “Public health importance” only touched on the incidence, prevalence and economic costs. What about the morbidity and mortality associated with dementia? Please expand.
- [ ]	Revise text on AD and VaD to reflect the evidence base from population based studies, including that from epidemiological neuropathology in which it is clear that dementia at older ages is mixed in aetiology and how this influences the study of all-cause dementia and its currently used subtypes.
- [ ]	What was the rationale/motivation for choosing lipid levels as your exposures of interest (Page 7; Paragraph 2 of section on Risk Factors)? This wasn’t communicated clearly in your thesis. There was mention of reducing the prevalence of the seven most important risk factors for dementia (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, physical inactivity, and low educational attainment) which could reduce the prevalence of dementia. Then you started the next paragraph with “In this context, lipid levels represent a promising target….” Make clearer how you arrived at lipid levels being a promising target for preventative treatment, given that there was no previous mention or discussion of this. Furthermore, you stated seven most important risk factors, but you only reported six. 
- [ ]	Section on “Randomised controlled trials”: Need to mention that another limitation of RCTs of statins in being unable to assess the causal effect of LDL-c lowering on dementia risk is due to the pleiotropic effects of statins. They modify levels of other markers such as C-reactive protein, which are also associated with dementia risk, hence difficult to attribute any changes to LDL-c alone.
- [ ]	The last paragraph of the section “Individual participant data meta-analysis” was written in the future tense (page 19). Please revise

__Chapters 3 & 4__
- [ ] You did perform meta-analyses in these chapters. Not sure why you did not include the term “meta-analysis” in the title; title should rather be “Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of existing evidence on the association between blood lipids and dementia outcomes” to reflect what was done.
- [ ] Tables of baseline characteristics do not report duration of follow-up especially for the non-randomised studies. This is very relevant in the context of the outcome dementia and biases such as reverse causation and regression dilution bias. Please include another column for these.
- [ ] Provide rationale for reporting RR as per SD increase. 

__Chapter 5__
- [ ] Page 143: Not sure what these results refer to “This finding disagrees with the results of the original analysis, which found evidence for a protective effect of statin use on all-cause dementia (HR: 0.81, 95%CI: 0.69-0.96) and non-AD dementia (HR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.69-0.97), but little evidence of an effect on AD (HR: 0.81, 95%CI: 0.49-1.35).”
Your original results showed that statin use was associated with increased risk of all-cause dementia, vascular dementia and other dementia. Please rephrase statement as not clear.

__Chapter 6__ 

- [ ] Regarding the findings of the associations of triglycerides with all-cause dementia using Whitehall cohort II, you found a harmful effect and Tynkkynen et al found a protective effect. Your potential reasons for the discrepancy include handling of missing data, difference in number of events, adjustment for ApoE status. Could the fact that you used ORs and the other study used HRs be responsible for the difference? Add a sentence or two for this.
- [ ] Regression dilution bias was never mentioned as a potential source of bias. It is an important source of bias in observational cohort studies and could be responsible for some of the null findings. It should be mentioned/discussed.

__Chapter 8__

- [ ] This needs to reflect the text that will have been inserted and modified in the background introduction to dementia in ageing populations with a critique of the emphasis on specific subtypes and how this can lead to curious findings because of diagnostic processes.
