Chapter 3/4,"Based on the available evidence; \newline (i) are lipid fractions associated with subsequent dementia risk, stratified by subtype? \newline (ii) Are lipid regulating agents associated with subsequent dementia risk, stratified by subtype? \newline","Lipids (HDL-c, LDL-c, TC, TG), \newline \newline Lipid regulating agents (statins, ezetimibe, fibrates, etc.)","Dementia, stratified by subtype","Provides overview of existing evidence, including detailed risk-of-bias assessments for each result"
Chapter 5,"Are lipid regulating agents associated with dementia risk in a large scale electronic health record database? \newline",Seven classes of lipid regulating agents,"Dementia, stratified by subtype","Provides additional observational data on vascular dementia (under-represented in the literature) \newline \newline Provides a source of observational evidence created using a method with distinct sources of bias to those identified by the systematic review"
Chapter 6,"Are lipid levels associated with dementia risk in previously unanalysed prospective cohort studies? \newline","Lipids (HDL-c, LDL-c, TC, TG)","All-cause dementia \newline VaD","Provides additional evidence from unanalysed datasets \newline \newline Provides additional observational data on vascular dementia (under-represented in the literature)"
