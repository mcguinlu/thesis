Chapter 3/4,"Based on the available evidence; \newline (i) are lipid fractions associated with subsequent dementia risk, stratified by subtype? \newline (ii) Are lipid regulating agents associated with subsequent dementia risk, stratified by subtype? \newline","Lipids (HDL-c, LDL-c, TC, TG), \newline \newline Lipid regulating agents (statins, ezetimibe, fibrates, etc.)","Dementia, stratified by subtype","Provides overview of existing evidence"
Chapter 5,"Are lipid regulating agents associated with dementia risk in a large scale electonic health record database? \newline",Seven classes of lipid regulating agents,"Dementia, stratified by subtype","Provides additional observational data on vascular dementia (under-represented in the literature) \newline \newline Provides a source of observational evidence created using a method with distinct sources of bias to those identified by the systematic review"
Chapter 6,"Are lipid levels associated with dementia risk in an individual participant data meta-analysis? \newline","Lipids (HDL-c, LDL-c, TC, TG)","Dementia, stratified by subtype","Provides additional evidence from unanalysed datasets \newline \newline Allows for stratification of effect by variables of interest (e.g. sex)"
