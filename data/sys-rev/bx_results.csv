1,4741,"HUMAN LONGEVITY IS INFLUENCED BY MANY GENETIC VARIANTS: EVIDENCE FROM 75,000 UK BIOBANK PARTICIPANTS","Variation in human lifespan is 20 to 30% heritable but few genetic variants have been identified. We undertook a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) using age at death of parents of middle-aged UK Biobank participants of European decent (n=75,244 with fathers and/or mothers data). Genetic risk scores for 19 phenotypes (n=777 proven variants) were also tested.\n\nGenotyped variants (n=845,997) explained 10.2% (SD=1.3%) of combined parental longevity. In GWAS, a locus in the nicotine receptor CHRNA3 - previously associated with increased smoking and lung cancer - was associated with paternal age at death, with each protective allele (rs1051730[G]) being associated with 0.03 years later age at fathers death (p=3x10-8). Offspring of longer lived parents had more protective alleles (lower genetic risk scores) for coronary artery disease, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, type-1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease and Alzheimers disease. In candidate gene analyses, variants in the TOMM40/APOE locus were associated with longevity (including rs429358, p=3x10-5), but FOXO variants were not associated.\n\nThese results support a multiple protective factors model for achieving longer lifespans in humans, with a prominent role for cardiovascular-related pathways. Several of these genetically influenced risks, including blood pressure and tobacco exposure, are potentially modifiable.",Luke C Pilling;Janice L Atkins;Kirsty Bowman;Samuel E Jones;Jessica Tyrrell;Robin N Beaumont;Katherine S Ruth;Marcus A Tuke;Hanieh Yaghootkar;Andrew R Wood;Rachel M Freathy;Anna Murray;Michael N Weedon;Luting Xue;Kathryn Lunetta;Joanne M Murabito;Lorna W Harries;Jean-Marie Robine;Carol Brayne;George A Kuchel;Luigi Ferrucci;Timothy M Frayling;David Melzer;,01/02/2016,Genomics ,10.1101/038430,1,David Melzer,"Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, University of Exeter Medical School, UK",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/038430v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/038430v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.18632/aging.100930,
2,5793,Genetic contributions to self-reported tiredness,"Self-reported tiredness and low energy, often called fatigue, is associated with poorer physical and mental health. Twin studies have indicated that this has a heritability between 6% and 50%. In the UK Biobank sample (N = 108 976) we carried out a genome-wide association study of responses to the question, \""Over the last two weeks, how often have you felt tired or had little energy?\"" Univariate GCTA-GREML found that the proportion of variance explained by all common SNPs for this tiredness question was 8.4% (SE = 0.6%). GWAS identified one genome-wide significant hit (Affymetrix id 1:64178756_C_T; p = 1.36 x 10-11). LD score regression and polygenic profile analysis were used to test for pleiotropy between tiredness and up to 28 physical and mental health traits from GWAS consortia. Significant genetic correlations were identified between tiredness and BMI, HDL cholesterol, forced expiratory volume, grip strength, HbA1c, longevity, obesity, self-rated health, smoking status, triglycerides, type 2 diabetes, waist-hip ratio, ADHD, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, neuroticism, schizophrenia, and verbal-numerical reasoning (absolute rg effect sizes between 0.11 and 0.78). Significant associations were identified between tiredness phenotypic scores and polygenic profile scores for BMI, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, coronary artery disease, HbA1c, height, obesity, smoking status, triglycerides, type 2 diabetes, and waist-hip ratio, childhood cognitive ability, neuroticism, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia (standardised {beta}s between -0.016 and 0.03). These results suggest that tiredness is a partly-heritable, heterogeneous and complex phenomenon that is phenotypically and genetically associated with affective, cognitive, personality, and physiological processes.\n\n\""Hech, sirs!

3,6373,Synthetic lipid-containing scaffolds enhance production by co-localizing enzymes,"Subcellular organization is critical for isolating, concentrating, and protecting biological activities. Natural subcellular organization is often achieved using co-localization of proteins on scaffold molecules, thereby enhancing metabolic fluxes and enabling co-regulation. Synthetic scaffolds extend these benefits to new biological processes, and are typically constructed from proteins or nucleic acids. To expand the range of available building materials, we use a minimal set of components from the lipid-encapsulated bacteriophage {Phi}6 to form synthetic lipid-containing scaffolds (SLSs) in E. coli. Analysis of diffusive behavior by tracking particles in live cells indicates that SLSs are >20 nm in diameter; furthermore, density measurements demonstrate that SLSs contain a mixture of lipids and proteins. The fluorescent proteins mCitrine and mCerulean can be co-localized to SLSs. To test for effects on enzymatic production, we localized two enzymes involved in indigo biosynthesis to SLSs. We observed a scaffold-dependent increase in indigo production, showing that SLSs can enhance metabolic reactions.",Cameron A. Myhrvold;Jessica K. Polka;Pamela A.

5,9688,"Genetic,transcriptome, proteomic and epidemiological evidence for blood brain barrier disruption and polymicrobial brain invasion as determinant factors in Alzheimers disease.","Multiple pathogens have been detected in Alzheimers disease (AD) brains. A bioinformatics approach was used to assess relationships between pathogens and AD genes (GWAS), the AD hippocampal transcriptome and plaque or tangle proteins. Host/pathogen interactomes (C.albicans, C.Neoformans, Bornavirus, B.Burgdorferri, cytomegalovirus, Ebola virus, HSV-1, HERV-W, HIV-1, Epstein-Barr, hepatitis C, influenza, C.Pneumoniae, P.Gingivalis, H.Pylori, T.Gondii, T.Cruzi) significantly overlap with misregulated AD hippocampal genes, with plaque and tangle proteins and, except Bornavirus, Ebola and HERV-W, with AD genes. Upregulated AD hippocampal genes match those upregulated by multiple bacteria, viruses, fungi or protozoa in immunocompetent blood cells. AD genes are enriched in bone marrow and immune locations and in GWAS datasets reflecting pathogen diversity, suggesting selection for pathogen resistance. The age of AD patients implies resistance to infections afflicting the younger. APOE4 protects against malaria and hepatitis C, and immune/inflammatory gain of function applies to APOE4, CR1, TREM2 and presenilin variants. 30/78 AD genes are expressed in the blood brain barrier (BBB), which is disrupted by AD risk factors (ageing, alcohol, aluminium, concussion, cerebral hypoperfusion, diabetes, homocysteine, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, obesity, pesticides, pollution, physical inactivity, sleep disruption and smoking). The BBB and AD benefit from statins, NSAIDs, oestrogen, melatonin and the Mediterranean diet. Polymicrobial involvement is supported by the upregulation of pathogen sensors/defenders (bacterial, fungal, viral) in the AD brain, blood or CSF. Cerebral pathogen invasion permitted by BBB inadequacy, activating a hyper-efficient immune/inflammatory system, betaamyloid and other antimicrobial defence may be responsible for AD which may respond to antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral therapy.",Chris J Carter;,12/10/2016,Neuroscience ,10.1101/080333,1,Chris J Carter,PolygenicPathways,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/080333v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/080333v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3233/ADR-170017,
6,12377,Family history and APOE4 risk for Alzheimer’s Disease impact the neural correlates of episodic memory by early midlife,"Episodic memory impairment is a consistent, pronounced deficit in pre-clinical stages of late-onset Alzheimers disease (AD). Individuals with risk factors for AD exhibit altered brain function several decades prior to the onset of AD-related symptoms. In the current event-related fMRI study of spatial context memory we tested the hypothesis that middle-aged adults (MA; 40-58yrs) with a family history of late onset AD (MA+FH), or a combined +FH and apolipoprotein E {varepsilon}4 allele risk factors for AD (MA+FH+APOE4), will exhibit differences in encoding and retrieval-related brain activity, compared to - FH-APOE4 MA controls. We also hypothesized that the two at-risk MA groups will exhibit distinct patterns of correlation between brain activity and memory performance, compared to controls. To test these hypotheses we conducted multivariate task, and behavior, partial least squares analysis of fMRI data obtained during successful context encoding and retrieval. Our results indicate that even though there were no significant group differences in context memory performance, there were significant differences in brain activity and brain-behavior correlations involving hippocampus, left angular gyrus, cingulate, and precuneus in MA with AD risk factors, compared to controls. In addition, we observed that brain activity and brain-behavior correlations in anterior-medial PFC and in ventral visual cortex differentiated the two MA risk groups from each other, and from MAcontrols. This is the first study to show that there are differences in the brain areas engaged during context memory encoding and retrieval in middle-aged adults with +FH and +APOE-4 risk factors for late onset AD, compared to controls.","Rajah, M.

7,14174,"Genome-wide association study of alcohol consumption and genetic overlap with other health-related traits in UK Biobank (N=112,117).","Alcohol consumption has been linked to over 200 diseases and is responsible for over 5% of the global disease burden. Well known genetic variants in alcohol metabolizing genes, e.g. ALDH2, ADH1B, are strongly associated with alcohol consumption but have limited impact in European populations where they are found at low frequency. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of self-reported alcohol consumption in 112,117 individuals in the UK Biobank (UKB) sample of white British individuals. We report significant genome-wide associations at 8 independent loci. These include SNPs in alcohol metabolizing genes (ADH1B/ADH1C/ADH5) and 2 loci in KLB, a gene recently associated with alcohol consumption. We also identify SNPs at novel loci including GCKR, PXDN, CADM2 and TNFRSF11A. Gene-based analyses found significant associations with genes implicated in the neurobiology of substance use (CRHR1, DRD2), and genes previously associated with alcohol consumption (AUTS2). GCTA-GREML analyses found a significant SNP-based heritability of self-reported alcohol consumption of 13% (S.E.=0.01). Sex-specific analyses found largely overlapping GWAS loci and the genetic correlation between male and female alcohol consumption was 0.73 (S.E.=0.09, p-value = 1.37 x 10-16). Using LD score regression, genetic overlap was found between alcohol consumption and schizophrenia (rG=0.13, S.E=0.04), HDL cholesterol (rG=0.21, S.E=0.05), smoking (rG=0.49, S.E=0.06) and various anthropometric traits (e.g. Overweight, rG=-0.19, S.E.=0.05). This study replicates the association between alcohol consumption and alcohol metabolizing genes and KLB, and identifies 4 novel gene associations that should be the focus of future studies investigating the neurobiology of alcohol consumption.","Clarke, T.-K.; Adams, M.

9,18284,Amyloid accumulation drives proteome-wide alterations in mouse models of Alzheimers disease like pathology,"Amyloid beta (A{beta}) peptides impair multiple cellular pathways in the brain and play a causative role in Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology, but how the brain proteome is remodeled during this process is unknown. To identify new protein networks associated with AD-like pathology, we performed global quantitative proteomic analysis in three mouse models at pre- and post-symptomatic ages. Our analysis revealed a robust and consistent increase in Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) levels in nearly all transgenic brain regions with increased A{beta} levels. Taken together with prior findings on ApoE driving A{beta} accumulation, this analysis points to a pathological dysregulation of the ApoE-A{beta} axis. We also found dysregulation of protein networks involved in excitatory synaptic transmission consistent with AD pathophysiology. Targeted analysis of the AMPA receptor complex revealed a specific loss of TARP{gamma}-2, a key AMPA receptor trafficking protein. Expression of TARP{gamma}-2 in vivo in hAPP transgenic mice led to a restoration of AMPA currents.

10,19037,Comprehensive Benchmarking and Ensemble Approaches for Metagenomic Classifiers,"BackgroundOne of the main challenges in metagenomics is the identification of microorganisms in clinical and environmental samples. While an extensive and heterogeneous set of computational tools is available to classify microorganisms using whole genome shotgun sequencing data, comprehensive comparisons of these methods are limited. In this study, we use the largest (n=35) to date set of laboratory-generated and simulated controls across 846 species to evaluate the performance of eleven metagenomics classifiers. We also assess the effects of filtering and combining tools to reduce the number of false positives.\n\nResultsTools were characterized on the basis of their ability to (1) identify taxa at the genus, species, and strain levels, (2) quantify relative abundance measures of taxa, and (3) classify individual reads to the species level. Strikingly, the number of species identified by the eleven tools can differ by over three orders of magnitude on the same datasets. However, various strategies can ameliorate taxonomic misclassification, including abundance filtering, ensemble approaches, and tool intersection. Indeed, leveraging tools with different heuristics is beneficial for improved precision. Nevertheless, these strategies were often insufficient to completely eliminate false positives from environmental samples, which are especially important where they concern medically relevant species and where customized tools may be required.\n\nConclusionsThe results of this study provide positive controls, titrated standards, and a guide for selecting tools for metagenomic analyses by comparing ranges of precision and recall. We show that proper experimental design and analysis parameters, including depth of sequencing, choice of classifier or classifiers, database size, and filtering, can reduce false positives, provide greater resolution of species in complex metagenomic samples, and improve the interpretation of results.","Mcintyre, A.; Ounit, R.; Afshinnekoo, E.; Prill, R.; Henaff, E.; Alexander, N.; Minot, S.; Danko, D.; Foox, J.; Ahsanuddin, S.; Tighe, S.; Hasan, N.

11,19515,"A large-scale genome-wide enrichment analysis identifies new trait-associated genes, pathways and tissues across 31 human phenotypes","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim to identify genetic factors that are associated with complex traits. Standard analyses test individual genetic variants, one at a time, for association with a trait. However, variant-level associations are hard to identify (because of small effects) and can be difficult to interpret biologically. \""Enrichment analyses\"" help address both these problems by focusing on sets of biologically-related variants. Here we introduce a new model-based enrichment analysis method that requires only GWAS summary statistics, and has several advantages over existing methods. Applying this method to interrogate 3,913 biological pathways and 113 tissue-based gene sets in 31 human phenotypes identifies many previously-unreported enrichments. These include enrichments of the endochondral ossification pathway for adult height, the NFAT-dependent transcription pathway for rheumatoid arthritis, brain-related genes for coronary artery disease, and liver-related genes for late-onset Alzheimers disease. A key feature of our method is that inferred enrichments automatically help identify new trait-associated genes. For example, accounting for enrichment in lipid transport genes yields strong evidence for association between MTTP and low-density lipoprotein levels, whereas conventional analyses of the same data found no significant variants near this gene.","Zhu, X.; Stephens, M.",16/07/2018,Genomics,10.1101/160770,2,Xiang Zhu,University of Chicago,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/160770v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/160770v2.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1038/s41467-018-06805-x,
12,20010,Polygenic hazard score: an enrichment marker for Alzheimer’s associated amyloid and tau deposition,"BackgroundThere is an urgent need for the early identification of nondemented individuals at the highest risk of progressing to Alzheimers disease (AD) dementia for early therapeutic interventions. Our goal was to evaluate whether a recently validated polygenic hazard score (PHS) can be integrated with known in vivo CSF or PET biomarkers of amyloid or tau pathology to prospectively predict cognitive decline and clinical progression to AD dementia in nondemented older individuals.\n\nMethodsWe evaluated 347 cognitive normal (CN) and 599 mild cognitively impaired (MCI) individuals. We first investigated whether PHS can predict CSF or PET amyloid and tau deposition. We evaluated differences in positive and negative predictive values of biomarker status, as a function of PHS risk. Next, we used linear mixed-effects (LME) to examine if PHS and biomarker status in conjunction, best predict longitudinal cognitive and clinical progression. Lastly, we used survival analysis to investigate whether a combination of PHS and biomarker positivity predicts progression to AD dementia better than using PHS or biomarker positivity alone.\n\nFindingsIn CN and MCI individuals, we found that amyloid and total tau positivity systematically varies as a function of PHS. For individuals in greater than the 50th percentile PHS, the positive predictive value for amyloid approached 100%. Similarly, for individuals in less than the 25th percentile PHS, the negative predictive value for total tau approached 85%. Beyond APOE, high PHS individuals with amyloid and tau pathology showed the fastest rate of longitudinal cognitive decline and time to AD dementia progression. Among the CN subgroup, we similarly found that PHS was strongly associated with amyloid positivity and the combination of PHS and biomarker status significantly predicted longitudinal clinical progression.\n\nInterpretationAmong asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic older individuals, PHS considerably improves the predictive value of CSF or PET amyloid and tau biomarkers. Beyond APOE, PHS may be useful for risk stratification and cohort enrichment for MCI and preclinical AD therapeutic trials.","Tan, C. H.; Fan, C. C.; Mormino, E. C.; Sugrue, L. P.; Broce, I.

Both atherosclerosis or non-atherosclerotic diffuse arteriopathy are involved.\n\nMETHODSA single-center, prospective, case-control study was performed in consecutive patients with different CSVD manifestations. The study group consisted of 205 patients: 52 with lacunar stroke (LS), 20 with subcortical hemorrhagic stroke (HS), 50 with vascular dementia (VaD), 28 with vascular parkinsonism (VaP) and 55 controls (CG) free of cerebrovascular disease but with high vascular risk.\n\nRESULTSPatients with CSVD had significantly higher prevalence of vascular risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, polymetabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease. Patients with CSVD had also significantly higher fasting blood glucose, homocysteine, fibrinogen, systolic blood pressure, IMT values and lower eGFR, albumin and HDL levels. After adjustment for age and sex, low eGFR, albumin and high levels of uric acid and fibrinogen were associated with all CSVD groups, elevated fasting glucose was related to LS and HS. In the multivariate analysiss, the independent predictors for CSVD were female sex, low albumin, high fibrinogen, fasting glucose and uric acid. Patients with LS had significantly higher IMT values comparing to other CSVD groups, patients with VaP had a trend towards higher homocysteine levels.\n\nCONCLUSIONRisk factor profile for CSVD as a whole differs from subjects with proatherogenic profile without history of cerebrovascular disease.

14,20430,Causal associations between risk factors and common diseases inferred from GWAS summary data,"Health risk factors such as body mass index (BMI), serum cholesterol and blood pressure are associated with many common diseases. It often remains unclear whether the risk factors are cause or consequence of disease, or whether the associations are the result of confounding. Genetic methods are useful to infer causality because genetic variants are present from birth and therefore unlikely to be confounded with environmental factors. We develop and apply a method (GSMR) that performs a multi-SNP Mendelian Randomization analysis using summary-level data from large genome-wide association studies (sample sizes of up to 405,072) to test the causal associations of BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, serum cholesterols, blood pressures, height and years of schooling (EduYears) with a range of common diseases. We identify a number of causal associations including a protective effect of LDL-cholesterol against type-2 diabetes (T2D) that might explain the side effects of statins on T2D, a protective effect of EduYears against Alzheimers disease, and bidirectional associations with opposite effects (e.g. higher BMI increases the risk of T2D but the effect T2D of BMI is negative). HDL-cholesterol has a significant risk effect on age-related macular degeneration, and the effect size remains significant accounting for the other risk factors. Our study develops powerful tools to integrate summary data from large studies to infer causality, and provides important candidates to be prioritized for further studies in medical research and for drug discovery.","Zhu, Z.; Zheng, Z.; Zhang, F.; Wu, Y.; Trzaskowski, M.; Maier, R.; Robinson, M.; Mcgrath, J.; Visscher, P.; Wray, N.; Yang, J.",26/07/2017,Genetics,10.1101/168674,1,Jian Yang,The University of Queensland,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168674v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/168674v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1038/s41467-017-02317-2,Y
15,20615,Exploring repositioning opportunities and side-effects of statins: a Mendelian randomization study of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition with 55 complex traits,"Statin is one of the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide. Besides reduction of cardiovascular risks, statins have been proposed for the prevention or treatment of other disorders, but results from clinical studies are mixed. There are also controversies concerning the adverse effects caused by statins.\n\nIn this study we employed a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach across a wide range of complex traits to explore repositioning opportunities and side-effects of statins. MR is analogous to a \""naturalistic\"" randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is much less susceptible to confounding and reverse causation as compared to observational studies.\n\nWe employed two genetic instruments (rs12916 and rs17238484) in the HMGCR gene which have been shown to provide reliable estimates of the risk of statins on type 2 diabetes and weight gain. We observed in the single- and joint-SNP analysis that low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction from HMG-CoA reductase inhibition results in increased depressive symptoms. This finding appeared to be supported by nominally significant results of raised major depression risk in single-SNP MR analysis of rs17238484, and analyses using LDL-C as the exposure. Several other outcomes also reached nominal significance (p < 0.05) in single- or joint-SNP analyses; for example, we observed causal associations of LDL-C lowering from HMG-CoA reductase inhibition with reduced risks of schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, as well as increased forearm bone mineral density, sleep duration and extreme longevity (highest q-value = 0.289). We also found evidence of casual relationships of LDL-C levels with schizophrenia, anorexia, sleep duration and longevity, following the same association directions as in analyses of HMGCR variants. These findings were at least partially supported by previous clinical studies. We did not observe associations with cognitive test profiles, renal outcomes, autoimmune diseases or cancers. While MR has its limitations and our findings remain to be confirmed in further studies, this work demonstrates the potential of a phenome-wide approach to reveal novel therapeutic indications and unknown drug side-effects.","So, H.-C.; Chau, C.

Recent genome-wide meta-analyses have identified 24 genomic loci linked to intelligence3-7, but much about its genetic underpinnings remains to be discovered. Here, we present the largest genetic association study of intelligence to date (N=279,930), identifying 206 genomic loci (191 novel) and implicating 1,041 genes (963 novel) via positional mapping, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping, chromatin interaction mapping, and gene-based association analysis. We find enrichment of genetic effects in conserved and coding regions and identify 89 nonsynonymous exonic variants. Associated genes are strongly expressed in the brain and specifically in striatal medium spiny neurons and cortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Gene-set analyses implicate pathways related to neurogenesis, neuron differentiation and synaptic structure. We confirm previous strong genetic correlations with several neuropsychiatric disorders, and Mendelian Randomization results suggest protective effects of intelligence for Alzheimers dementia and ADHD, and bidirectional causation with strong pleiotropy for schizophrenia. These results are a major step forward in understanding the neurobiology of intelligence as well as genetically associated neuropsychiatric traits.","Savage, J. E.; Jansen, P.

The recent availability of genome-wide association study (GWAS) results have made the polygenic risk score (PRS) approach a powerful way to perform genetic prediction and identify genetic overlap among phenotypes.\n\nMethods and findingsHere we use the PRS method to assess evidence for shared genetic aetiology across hundreds of traits within a single epidemiological study - the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966). We replicate numerous recent findings, such as a genetic association between Alzheimers disease and lipid levels, while the depth of phenotyping in the NFBC1966 highlights a range of novel significant genetic associations between traits.\n\nConclusionsThis study illustrates the power in taking a hypothesis-free approach to the study of shared genetic aetiology between human traits and diseases. It also demonstrates the potential of the PRS method to provide important biological insights using only a single well-phenotyped epidemiological study of moderate sample size (~5k), with important advantages over evaluating genetic correlations from GWAS summary statistics only.","Socrates, A.; Bond, T.; Karhunen, V.; Auvinen, J.; Rietveld, C.; Veijola, J.; Jarvelin, M.-R.; O'reilly, P.",14/10/2017,Genetics,10.1101/203257,1,Paul O'reilly,King's College London,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/203257v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/203257v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,NA,

Many studies now examine the connectivity and microstructure of the brains neural pathways, spurring the development of algorithms to extract and measure tracts and fiber bundles. Clustering white matter (WM) fibers, from whole-brain tractography, into anatomically meaningful bundles is still a challenging problem. Existing tract segmentation methods use atlases or regions of interest (ROI) or unsupervised spectral clustering. Even so, atlas-based segmentation does not always partition the brain into a set of recognizable fiber bundles. Deep learning techniques can be applied to automatically segment and cluster white matter fibers. Here we propose a robust approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn shape features of the fiber bundles, which we then exploit to cluster WM fibers into bundles. In a range of tests across diverse fiber bundles, we illustrate the accuracy of our method, and its ability to suppress false positive fibers.","Gupta, V.; Thomopoulos, S. I.; Corbin, C.; Rashid, F.

20,27593,"Characterizing the effects of sex, APOE <U+025B>4, and literacy on mid-life cognitive trajectories: Application of Information-Theoretic model-averaging and multi-model inference techniques to the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention Study","In this paper we apply Information-Theoretic (IT) model averaging to characterize a set of complex interactions in a longitudinal study on cognitive decline. Prior research has identified numerous genetic (including sex), education, health and lifestyle factors that predict abnormal cognitive decline.Traditional model selection approaches (e.g., backward or stepwise selection), attempt to find models that best fit the observed data; these techniques risk interpretations that only the selected predictors are important. In reality, several models may fit similarly well but result in different conclusions (e.g., about size and significance of parameter estimates), and inference from a single model chosen after a selection procedure can lead to overly simplistic conclusions. Here we utilize longitudinal cognitive data from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimers Prevention to examine the effects of sex and the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 allele (non-modifiable factors), and reading literacy achievement (modifiable) on cognitive decline. For each outcome, we applied IT model averaging to a model set with combinations of interactions among sex, APOE, literacy, and age. For a list-learning test, model-averaged results showed better performance for women vs men, with faster decline among men; increased literacy was associated with better performance, particularly among men. APOE had less effect in this age range (~40-70). These results illustrate the utility of the IT approach and point to verbal ability as a potential modifier of decline. Whether the protective effect of literacy is due to educational attainment or intrinsic verbal intellectual ability is the topic of ongoing work.","Koscik, R. L.; Norton, D. L.; Allison, S.

24,29183,The Amyloid Clearance Defect in ApoE4 Astrocytes is Corrected by Epigenetic Restoration of NHE6,"The accumulation of amyloid protein A{beta} in senile plaques is a key driver and hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD), a major cause of death and dementia in the elderly. The strongest genetic risk factor in sporadic AD is the {varepsilon}4 allele of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE4), which potentiates pre-symptomatic endosomal dysfunction and defective clearance of A{beta}, although how these two pathways are linked has been unclear. Here, we show that aberrant accumulation of endosomal protons in ApoE4 astrocytes traps the LRP1 receptor in non-productive intracellular compartments, leading to loss of surface expression and A{beta} clearance. Hyperacidification of endosomal pH is caused by selective down regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE6, which functions as a critical proton leak pathway, in ApoE4 brain and astrocytes. In vivo, the NHE6KO mouse model shows elevated A{beta} in the brain. Epigenetic restoration of NHE6 expression with histone deacetylase inhibitors normalized ApoE4-specific defects in endosomal pH, LRP1 trafficking and amyloid clearance. Thus, NHE6 is a prominent effector of ApoE4 and emerges as a promising therapeutic target in Alzheimer disease.","Prasad, H.; Rao, R.",04/01/2018,Neuroscience,10.1101/243097,1,Rajini Rao,Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/243097v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/243097v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1073/pnas.1801612115,
25,30174,A conserved mechanism for regulation of endo-lysosomal pH by histone deacetylases,"The pH of the endo-lysosomal system is tightly regulated by a balance of proton pump and leak mechanisms that are critical for storage, recycling, turnover and signaling functions in the cell. Dysregulation of endo-lysosomal pH has been linked to aging, amyloidogenesis, synaptic dysfunction, and various neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers disease. Therefore, understanding mechanisms that regulate luminal pH may be key to identifying new targets for treatment of these disorders. Meta-analysis of yeast microarray databases revealed that nutrient limiting conditions upregulated transcription of the endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger Nhx1 by inhibition of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Rpd3, resulting in vacuolar alkalinization. Consistent with these findings, Rpd3 inhibition by the HDAC inhibitor and antifungal drug trichostatin A induced Nhx1 expression and vacuolar alkalinization. Bioinformatics analysis of Drosophila and mouse databases revealed that caloric control of Nhx1 orthologs DmNHE3 and NHE6 respectively, was also mediated by histone deacetylases. We show that NHE6 is a target of cAMP-response element-binding (CREB) protein, providing a molecular mechanism for nutrient and HDAC dependent regulation of endosomal pH. Control of NHE6 expression by pharmacological targeting of the CREB pathway can be used to regulate endosomal pH and restore defective amyloid A{beta} clearance in an ApoE4 astrocyte model of Alzheimers disease. These observations from yeast, fly, mouse and cell culture models reveal an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for regulation of endosomal NHE expression by histone deacetylases and offer new therapeutic strategies for modulation of endo-lysosomal pH in fungal infection and human disease.","Rao, R.; Prasad, H.",22/01/2018,Molecular Biology,10.1101/252122,1,Rajini Rao,Johns Hopkins University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/252122v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/252122v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.1074/jbc.RA118.002025,
26,32046,Genetic meta-analysis identifies 9 novel loci and functional pathways for Alzheimers disease risk,"Late onset Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with more than 35 million people affected worldwide, and no curative treatment available. AD is highly heritable and recent genome-wide meta-analyses have identified over 20 genomic loci associated with AD, yet only explaining a small proportion of the genetic variance indicating that undiscovered loci exist. Here, we performed the largest genome-wide association study of clinically diagnosed AD and AD-by-proxy (71,880 AD cases, 383,378 controls). AD-by-proxy status is based on parental AD diagnosis, and showed strong genetic correlation with AD (rg=0.81). Genetic meta analysis identified 29 risk loci, of which 9 are novel, and implicating 215 potential causative genes. Independent replication further supports these novel loci in AD. Associated genes are strongly expressed in immune-related tissues and cell types (spleen, liver and microglia). Furthermore, gene-set analyses indicate the genetic contribution of biological mechanisms involved in lipid-related processes and degradation of amyloid precursor proteins. We show strong genetic correlations with multiple health-related outcomes, and Mendelian randomisation results suggest a protective effect of cognitive ability on AD risk.

27,30906,Impaired Spatial Reorientation in the 3xTg-AD Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease,"In early Alzheimers disease (AD) spatial navigation is impaired; however, the precise cause of this impairment is unclear. Recent evidence suggests that getting lost in new surroundings is one of the first impairments to emerge in AD. It is possible that getting lost in new surroundings represents a failure to use distal cues to get oriented in space. Therefore, we set out to look for impaired use of distal cues for spatial orientation in a mouse model of amyloidosis (3xTg-AD). To do this, we trained mice to shuttle to the end of a track and back to an enclosed start box to receive a water reward. Then, mice were trained to stop in an unmarked reward zone to receive a brain stimulation reward. The time required to remain in the zone for a reward was increased across training, and the track was positioned in a random start location for each trial. We found that 6-month female, but not male, 3xTg-AD mice were impaired. Male and female mice had only intracellular pathology and male mice had less pathology, particularly in the dorsal hippocampus. Thus, AD may cause spatial disorientation as a result of impaired use of landmarks.","Stimmell, A. C.; Baglietto-Vargas, D.; Moseley, S. C.; Lapointe, V.; Thompson, L. M.; Laferla, F.

28,32177,Streptococcal Lancefield polysaccharides are critical cell wall determinants for human group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 to exert its bactericidal effects,"Human Group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (hGIIA) is an acute phase protein with bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Infection models in hGIIA transgenic mice have suggested the importance of hGIIA as an innate defense mechanism against the human pathogens Group A Streptococcus (GAS) and Group B Streptococcus (GBS). Compared to other Gram-positive bacteria, GAS is remarkably resistant to hGIIA activity. To identify GAS resistance mechanisms, we exposed a highly saturated GAS M1 transposon library to recombinant human hGIIA and compared relative mutant abundance with library input through transposon-sequencing (Tn-seq). Based on transposon prevalence in the output library, we identified nine genes, including dltA and lytR, conferring increased hGIIA susceptibility. In addition, seven genes conferred increased hGIIA resistance, which included two genes, gacH and gacI that are located within the Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) gene cluster. Using GAS 5448 wild-type and the isogenic gacI mutant and gacI-complemented strains, we demonstrate that loss of the GAC N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) side chain in the{Delta} gacI mutant increases hGIIA resistance approximately 10-fold, a phenotype that is conserved across different GAS serotypes. Increased resistance is associated with delayed penetration of hGIIA through the cell wall. Correspondingly, loss of the Lancefield Group B Carbohydrate (GBC) rendered GBS significantly more resistant to hGIIA-mediated killing. This suggests that the streptococcal Lancefield antigens, which are critical determinants for streptococcal physiology and virulence, are required for the human bactericidal enzyme hGIIA to exert its bactericidal function.\n\nAuthor summaryThe human immune system is capable of killing invading bacteria by secreting antimicrobial proteins. Cationic human Group IIA secreted phospholipase A2 (hGIIA) is especially effective against Gram-positive bacteria by degrading the bacterial membrane. HGIIA requires binding to negatively charged surface structures before it can penetrate through the thick peptidoglycan layer and reach the target phospholipid membrane. HGIIA is constitutively expressed at high concentrations at sites of possible bacterial entry, e.g. in tears, skin and small intestine. In serum, normal concentrations are low but can increase up to 1,000-fold upon inflammation or infection. In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo experiments suggest an important role for hGIIA in defense against two human pathogens, Group A and Group B Streptococcus (GAS, GBS). We demonstrate that the Lancefield cell wall polysaccharides that are expressed by these bacteria, the Group A Carbohydrate (GAC) for GAS and the Group B Carbohydrate (GBC) for GBS, are required for optimal hGIIA bactericidal efficacy by facilitating penetration through the peptidoglycan layer. Given the increased hGIIA resistance of antigen-modified or antigen-deficient streptococci, it will be of interest to determine potential regulatory mechanisms regarding expression of streptococcal Lancefield polysaccharides.","Van Hensbergen, V.

29,33162,DNA methylation age acceleration and risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease,"INTRODUCTIONThe  epigenetic clock is a DNA methylation-based estimate of biological age and is correlated with chronological age - the greatest risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). Genetic and environmental risk factors exist for AD, several of which are potentially modifiable. Here, we assess the relationship associations between the epigenetic clock and AD risk factors.\n\nMETHODSLinear mixed modelling was used to assess the relationship between age acceleration (the residual of biological age regressed onto chronological age) and AD risk factors relating to cognitive reserve, lifestyle, disease, and genetics in the Generation Scotland study (n=5,100).\n\nRESULTSWe report significant associations between the epigenetic clock and BMI, total:HDL cholesterol ratios, socioeconomic status, and smoking behaviour (Bonferroni-adjusted P<0.05).\n\nDISCUSSIONAssociations are present between environmental risk factors for AD and age acceleration. Measures to modify such risk factors might improve the risk profile for AD and the rate of biological ageing. Future longitudinal analyses are therefore warranted.","Mccartney, D. L.; Stevenson, A.

30,33765,Altered Bile Acid Profile Associates with Cognitive Impairment in Alzheimer’s Disease – An Emerging Role for Gut Microbiome,"IntroductionIncreasing evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiome in central nervous system disorders and specific role for the gut-brain axis in neurodegeneration. Bile acids (BA), products of cholesterol metabolism and clearance, are produced in the liver and are further metabolized by gut bacteria. They have major regulatory and signaling functions and seem dysregulated in Alzheimer disease (AD).\n\nMethodsSerum levels of 15 primary and secondary BAs and their conjugated forms were measured in 1,464 subjects including 370 cognitively normal older adults (CN), 284 with early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 505 with late MCI, and 305 AD cases enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. We assessed associations of BA profiles including selected ratios with diagnosis, cognition, and AD-related genetic variants, adjusting for cofounders and multiple testing.\n\nResultsIn AD compared to CN, we observed significantly lower serum concentrations of a primary BA (cholic acid CA) and increased levels of the bacterially produced, secondary BA, deoxycholic acid (DCA), and its glycine and taurine conjugated forms. An increased ratio of DCA:CA, which reflects 7-dehydroxylation of CA by gut bacteria, strongly associated with cognitive decline, a finding replicated in serum and brain samples in the Rush Religious Orders and Memory and Aging Project. Several genetic variants in immune response related genes implicated in AD showed associations with BA profiles.\n\nConclusionWe report for the first time an association between altered BA profile, genetic variants implicated in AD and cognitive changes in disease using a large multicenter study. These findings warrant further investigation of gut dysbiosis and possible role of gut liver brain axis in the pathogenesis of AD.","Mahmoudiandehkordi, S.; Arnold, M.; Nho, K.; Ahmad, S.; Jia, W.; Xia, G.; Louie, G.; Kueider, A.; Moseley, M.

31,33674,Progressive impairment of directional and spatially precise trajectories by TgF344-AD Rats in the Morris Water Task,"Spatial navigation is impaired in early stages of Alzheimers disease (AD), and may be a defining behavioral marker of preclinical AD. Nevertheless, limitations of diagnostic criteria for AD and within animal models of AD make characterization of preclinical AD difficult. A new rat model (TgF344-AD) of AD overcomes many of these limitations, though spatial navigation has not been comprehensively assessed. Using the hidden and cued platform variants of the Morris water task, a longitudinal assessment of spatial navigation was conducted on TgF344-AD (n=16) and Fischer 344 (n=12) male and female rats at three age ranges: 4 to 5 months, 7 to 8, and 10 to 11 months of age. TgF344-AD rats exhibited largely intact navigation at 4-5 and 7-8 months of age, with deficits in the hidden platform task emerging at 10-11 months of age. In general, TgF344-AD rats displayed less accurate swim trajectories to the platform and a wider search area around the platform region compared to wildtype rats. Impaired navigation occurred in the absence of deficits in acquiring the procedural task demands or navigation to the cued platform location. Together, the results indicate that TgF344-AD rats exhibit comparable deficits to those found in individuals in the early stages of AD.","Berkowitz, L. E.; Harvey, R. E.; Drake, E.; Thompson, S.

33,34094,Perturbed functional networks in Alzheimers Disease reveal opposing roles for TGIF and EGR3,"While Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia, complex combinations of the underlying pathologies have led to evolved concepts in clinical and neuropathological criteria in the past decade. Pathological AD can be decomposed into subsets of individuals with significantly different antemortem cognitive decline rates. Using transcriptome as a proxy for functional state, we preselected 414 expression profiles of clinically and neuropathologically confirmed AD subjects and age matched non-demented controls sampled from a large community based neuropathological study. By combining brain tissue specific protein interactome with gene network, we identify functionally distinct composite clusters of genes which reveal extensive changes in expression levels in AD. The average global expression for clusters corresponding to synaptic transmission, metabolism, cell cycle, survival and immune response were downregulated while the upregulated cluster had a large set of uncharacterized pathways and processes that may constitute an AD specific phenotypic signature. We identified four master regulators across all clusters of differentially expressed genes by enrichment analysis including TGIF1 and EGR3. These transcription factors have previously not been associated with AD and were validated in brain tissue samples from an independent AD cohort. We identify TGIF1, a transcriptional repressor as being neuroprotective in AD by activating co-repressors regulating genes critical for DNA repair, maintaining homeostasis and arresting cell cycle. In addition, we show that loss of EGR3 regulation, mediates synaptic deficits by targeting the synaptic vesicle cycle. Collectively, our results highlight the utility of integrating protein interactions with gene perturbations to generate a comprehensive framework for characterizing the alterations in molecular network as applied to AD.","Canchi, S.; Raao, B.; Masliah, D.; Rosenthal, S.

34,34165,Expression of fatty acid transport protein in retinal pigment cells promotes lipid droplet expansion and photoreceptor homeostasis,"Increasing evidence suggests that dysregulation of lipid metabolism is associated with neurodegeneration in retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and in brain disorders such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases. Lipid storage organelles (lipid droplets, LDs), accumulate in many cell types in response to stress, and it is now clear that LDs function not only as lipid stores but also as dynamic regulators of the stress response. However, whether these LD functions are always protective or can also be deleterious to the cell is unknown. Here, we investigated the consequences of LD accumulation on retinal cell homeostasis in transgenic flies and mice overexpressing fatty acid transport protein (FATP) in retinal pigment cells (RPCs). In wild-type Drosophila, overexpression of dFatp specifically in RPCs resulted in an expansion of LD size in both RPCs and in neighboring photoreceptors but was non-toxic. Similarly, in mice, LD accumulation induced by RPC-specific expression of human FATP1 was non-toxic and promoted mitochondrial energy metabolism in both RPCs and photoreceptor cells. In contrast, RPC-specific dFatp knockdown reduced neurodegeneration in Aats-metFB Drosophila mutants, which carry a defective respiratory chain, indicating that abnormal LD accumulation can be toxic under pathological conditions. Collectively, these findings indicate that FATP-mediated LD formation in RPCs induces a non-autonomous increase of LDs in photoreceptors that promotes homeostasis under physiological conditions but can be deleterious under pathological conditions.\n\nAuthor SummaryLipids are major cell constituents and are present in the membranes, as free lipids in the cytoplasm, or stored in vesicles called lipid droplets (LDs). Under conditions of stress, lipids stored in LDs can be released to serve as substrates for energy metabolism by mitochondria. However, lipid storage is deregulated in many degenerative disorders such as age-related macular degeneration and Alzheimers disease. Thus, it is unclear whether accumulation of LDs is protective or can also be toxic. To address this question, we examined the consequences of enforced LD accumulation on the health of retinal cells in flies and mice. Like humans, fly and mouse retinas contain retinal pigment cells (RPC) that support the functions of neighboring photoreceptor cells. We found that overexpression of the fatty acid transport protein (FATP) in RPCs induced accumulation of LDs in both transgenic flies and mice. Moreover, LD accumulation in RPCs had a beneficial effect on juxtaposed photoreceptors under normal physiological conditions, but was toxic under pathological stress conditions. We propose that lipid storage is a mechanism of cellular communication that is essential to maintain photoreceptor health.","Van Den Brink, D.; Cubizolle, A.; Chatelain, G.; Napoletano, F.; Dourlen, P.; Davoust, N.; Guillou, L.; Angebault-Prouteau, C.; Bernoud-Hubac, N.; Guichardant, M.; Brabet, P.; Mollereau, B.",23/03/2018,Cell Biology,10.1101/287672,1,Bertrand Mollereau,"Laboratoire de Biologie et Modelisation de la Cellule, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/287672v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/287672v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA,

It has been reported that it that it showed various pharmacological actions via anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory actions. The present study undergoes the therapeutic evaluation of curcumin in cigarette smoke extract (CSE) exposure induced cognitive impairment in zebrafish. Methods: The cognitive impairment was induced by exposure to 25 ml of 200 % CSE; 10 minutes/day, for 7 consecutive days. The pre-treatment of curcumin (10 and 20 mg/kg) and montelukast(20 mg/kg) were exposed in 25 ml drug solution (10 minutes/day for 10 consecutive days). The changes of CSE induced cognitive dysfunction were evaluated by using different test methods such as colour recognition test; partition preference test; horizontal compartment test; and T-Maze tests. Further, the CSE exposure induced changes of biochemical parameters i.e., acetylcholinesterase activity; lipid peroxidation; reduced glutathione; and total protein levels were estimated in the brain of zebrafish. The pre-exposure of curcumin shown to produce the ameliorative effect against CSE induced neurocognitive impairments along with alteration of biochemical changes. Theseresults were comparable to reference control i.e., montelukast pre-treated group. Therefore, the curcumin can be served as newer medicines for immunological reaction associated neurocognitive disorders like Alzheimer and multiple sclerosis due to its potential anti-oxidative; anti-inflammatory; immunomodulatory; and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory actions.\n\nSUMMARYLoss of memory is a major problem in old age population.

To identify additional LOAD risk loci, the we performed the largest GWAS to date (89,769 individuals), analyzing both common and rare variants. We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify four new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, and ADAMTS1). Pathway analysis of these data implicates the immune system and lipid metabolism, and for the first time tau binding proteins and APP metabolism. These findings show that genetic variants affecting APP and A{beta} processing are not only associated with early-onset autosomal dominant AD but also with LOAD.

37,35847,Identification of 12 genetic loci associated with human healthspan,"The mounting challenge of preserving the quality of life in an aging population directs the focus of longevity science to the regulatory pathways controlling healthspan. To understand the nature of the relationship between the healthspan and lifespan and uncover the genetic architecture of the two phenotypes, we studied the incidence of major age-related diseases in the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort. We observed that the incidence rates of major chronic diseases increase exponentially. The risk of disease acquisition doubled approximately every eight years, i.e., at a rate compatible with the doubling time of the Gompertz mortality law. Assuming that aging is the single underlying factor behind the morbidity rates dynamics, we built a proportional hazards model to predict the risks of the diseases and therefore the age corresponding to the end of healthspan of an individual depending on their age, gender, and the genetic background. We suggested a computationally efficient procedure for the determination of the effect size and statistical significance of individual gene variants associations with healthspan in a form suitable for a Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). Using the UKB sub-population of 300,447 genetically Caucasian, British individuals as a discovery cohort, we identified 12 loci associated with healthspan and reaching the whole-genome level of significance. We observed strong (|{rho}g| > 0.3) genetic correlations between healthspan and the incidence of specific age-related disease present in our healthspan definition (with the notable exception of dementia). Other examples included all-cause mortality (as derived from parental survival, with{rho} g = -0.76), life-history traits (metrics of obesity, age at first birth), levels of different metabolites (lipids, amino acids, glycemic traits), and psychological traits (smoking behaviour, cognitive performance, depressive symptoms, insomnia). We conclude by noting that the healthspan phenotype, suggested and characterized here, offers a promising new way to investigate human longevity by exploiting the data from genetic and clinical data on living individuals.","Zenin, A.; Tsepilov, Y.; Sharapov, S.; Getmantsev, E.; Menshikov, L.; Fedichev, P.; Aulchenko, Y.",16/04/2018,Epidemiology,10.1101/300889,1,Peter Fedichev,Gero LLC,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/300889v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/300889v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1038/s42003-019-0290-0,
38,36687,AAV-mediated progranulin delivery to a mouse model of progranulin deficiency causes T cell-mediated hippocampal degeneration,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene replacement is emerging as a safe and effective means of correcting single-gene mutations, and use of AAV vectors for treatment of diseases of the CNS is increasing. AAV-mediated progranulin gene (GRN) delivery has been proposed as a treatment for GRN-deficient frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), and two recent studies using focal intraparenchymal AAV-Grn delivery to brain have shown moderate success in histopathologic and behavioral rescue in mouse FTD models. Here, we used AAV9 to deliver GRN to the lateral ventricle to achieve widespread expression in the Grn null mouse brain. We found that despite a global increase in progranulin throughout many brain regions, overexpression of GRN resulted in dramatic and selective hippocampal toxicity and degeneration affecting both neurons and glia. Histologically, hippocampal degeneration was preceded by T cell infiltration and perivascular cuffing, suggesting an inflammatory component to the ensuing neuronal loss. GRN delivery with an ependymal-targeting AAV for selective secretion of progranulin into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) similarly resulted in T cell infiltration as well as ependymal hypertrophy. Interestingly, overexpression of GRN in wild-type animals also provoked T cell infiltration. These results call into question the safety of GRN overexpression in the CNS, with evidence for both a region-selective immune response and cellular proliferative response following GRN gene delivery. Our results highlight the importance of careful consideration of target gene biology and cellular response to overexpression in relevant animal models prior to progressing to the clinic.\n\nSignificance StatementGene therapies using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors show great promise for many human diseases, including diseases that affect the central nervous system (CNS). Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) are neurodegenerative diseases resulting from loss of one or both copies of the gene encoding progranulin (GRN), and gene replacement has been proposed for these currently untreatable disorders. Here, we used two different AAV vectors to induce widespread brain GRN expression in mice lacking the gene, as well as in wild-type mice. Unexpectedly, GRN overexpression resulted in T cell infiltration, followed by marked hippocampal neurodegeneration. Our results call into question the safety of GRN overexpression in the CNS, with wider implications for development of CNS gene therapies.","Amado, D. A.; Rieders, J.

40,38788,Improved prediction of chronological age from DNA methylation limits it as a biomarker of ageing,"DNA methylation is associated with age. The deviation of age predicted from DNA methylation from actual age has been proposed as a biomarker for ageing. However, a better prediction of chronological age implies less opportunity for biological age. Here we used 13,661 samples (from blood and saliva) in the age range of 2 to 104 years from 14 cohorts measured on Illumina HumanMethylation450/EPIC arrays to perform prediction analyses. We show that increasing the sample size achieves a smaller prediction error and higher correlations in test datasets. We demonstrate that smaller prediction errors provide a limit to how much variation in biological ageing can be captured by methylation and provide evidence that age predictors from small samples are prone to confounding by cell composition. Our predictor shows a similar or better performance in non-blood tissues including saliva, endometrium, breast, liver, adipose and muscle, compared with Horvaths across-tissue age predictor.","Zhang, Q.; Vallerga, C.; Walker, R.; Lin, T.; Henders, A.; Montgomery, G.; He, J.; Fan, D.; Fowdar, J.; Kennedy, M.; Pitcher, T.; Pearson, J.; Halliday, G.; Kwok, J.; Hickie, I.; Lewis, S.; Anderson, T.; Silburn, P.; Mellick, G.; Harris, S.

However, APP distribution across different subcellular membrane compartments and its function in neurons remains unclear. We generated an APP fusion protein with a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein at its ectodomain and a pH-insensitive blue fluorescent protein at its cytosolic domain and used it to measure APPs distribution, subcellular trafficking and cleavage in live neurons. This reporter, closely resembling endogenous APP, revealed only a limited correlation between synaptic activities and APP trafficking. However, the synaptic surface distribution of APP was inversely correlated to membrane cholesterol levels, a phenomenon that involves APPs cholesterol-binding site. Mutations within this site not only altered surface APP and cholesterol levels in a dominant negative manner, but also increased synaptic vulnerability to moderate membrane cholesterol reduction. Our results reveal reciprocal modulation of APP and membrane cholesterol levels at synaptic boutons.","Delbove, C. E.; Strothman, C. E.; Lazarenko, R.

ORs with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were 1.29 (95% CI 1.11; 1.50) for the GS, as compared to 1.00 (95%CI 0.96; 1.04) for incident T2DM in PCSK9 inhibitor trials. No genetic associations were observed for cancer, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or Alzheimers disease - outcomes for which large-scale trial data were unavailable.\n\nConclusionsGenetic variation at the PCSK9 locus recapitulates the effects of therapeutic inhibition of PCSK9 on major blood lipid fractions and MI. Apparent discordance between genetic associations and trial outcome for T2DM might be explained lack by a of statistical precision, or differences in the nature and duration of genetic versus pharmacological perturbation of PCSK9.\n\nFundingThis research was funded by the British Heart Foundation (SP/13/6/30554, RG/10/12/28456, FS/18/23/33512), UCL Hospitals NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, by the Rosetrees and Stoneygate Trusts.\n\nCondensed abstractEvidence on the long-term efficacy and safety of therapeutic inhibition of PCSK9 is lacking. To explore potential long-term effects of PCSK9 inhibition, we characterised the phenotypic consequence of LDL-cholesterol lowering variants at the PCSK9 locus. A PCSK9 gene score comprising 4 SNPs recapitulated the effects of therapeutic inhibition of PCSK9 on major blood lipid fractions and risk of myocardial infarction, and was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. No associations with safety outcomes such as cancer, COPD, Alzheimers disease or atrial fibrillation were identified. Our findings suggest PCSK9 inhibition may be safe and effective during prolonged use.","Schmidt, A. F.; Holmes, M. V.; Preiss, D.; Swerdlow, D.

43,39516,Identification of a novel tetrameric structure for human apolipoprotein-D,"Apolipoprotein-D is a 25 kDa glycosylated member of the lipocalin family that folds into an eight-stranded {beta}-barrel with a single adjacent -helix. Apolipoprotein-D specifically binds a range of small hydrophobic ligands such as progesterone and arachidonic acid and has an antioxidant function that is in part due to the reduction of peroxidised lipids by methionine-93. Therefore, apolipoprotein-D plays multiple roles throughout the body and is protective in Alzheimers disease, where apolipoprotein-D overexpression reduces the amyloid-{beta} burden in Alzheimers disease mouse models.\n\nOligomerisation is a common feature of lipocalins that can influence ligand binding. The native structure of apolipoprotein-D, however, has not been conclusively defined. Apolipoprotein-D is generally described as a monomeric protein, although it dimerises when reducing peroxidised lipids.\n\nHere, we investigated the native structure of apolipoprotein-D derived from plasma, breast cyst fluid (BCF) and cerebrospinal fluid. In plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, apolipoprotein-D was present in high-molecular weight complexes, potentially in association with lipoproteins. In contrast, apolipoprotein-D in BCF formed distinct oligomeric species. We assessed apolipoprotein-D oligomerisation using native apolipoprotein-D purified from BCF and a suite of complementary methods, including multi-angle laser light scattering, analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering. Our analyses showed that apolipoprotein-D predominantly forms a {bsim}95 to {bsim}100 kDa tetramer. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis confirmed these findings and provided a structural model for apolipoprotein-D tetramer. These data indicate apolipoprotein-D rarely exists as a free monomer under physiological conditions and provide insights into novel native structures of apolipoprotein-D and into oligomerisation behaviour in the lipocalin family.","Kielkopf, C.

44,40525,Microglial and Astrocyte priming in the APP/PS1 model of Alzheimer’s Disease: increased vulnerability to acute inflammation and cognitive deficits,"Alzheimers disease (AD) causes devastating cognitive decline and has no disease-modifying therapies. Neuroinflammation is a significant contributor to disease progression but its precise contribution remains unclear. An emerging literature indicates that secondary inflammatory insults including acute trauma and infection alter the trajectory of chronic neurodegenerative diseases and the roles of microglia and astrocytes require elucidation. The current study, using the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, demonstrates that microglia are primed by {beta}-amyloid pathology to induce exaggerated IL-1{beta} responses to acute stimulation with LPS or IL-1{beta}. Despite disease-associated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, evidenced by ASC speck formation, APP/PS1 microglial cells show neither IL-1{beta} induction nor NF{kappa}B p65 nuclear localisation. Upon secondary stimulation with LPS or IL-1{beta}, NF{kappa}B-p65 nuclear localisation and exaggerated pro-IL-1 induction occur. Microglial priming was also unmasked by secondary stimulation with systemic LPS leading to significant cognitive impairment in APP/PS1 mice compared to WT LPS-treated mice. Astrocytes have also recently emerged as displaying significant phenotypic heterogeneity. Here, by-passing microglial priming, and acutely challenging mice with intra-hippocampal IL-1{beta} we demonstrate that astrocytes proximal to A{beta}-plaques are also primed to produce exaggerated CCL2, CXCL1 and CXCL10 responses. Many astrocytosis-associated genes in APP/PS1 mice share these exaggerated responses to IL-1{beta}, while others are equally induced in both strains. Collectively the data show that the amyloid-laden brain shows multiple vulnerabilities to secondary inflammatory challenge: both microglia and astrocytes are primed to produce exaggerated secondary inflammation and systemic LPS is sufficient to cause cognitive impairments relevant to delirium, selectively in animals with prior amyloid pathology.","Lopez-Rodriguez, A.

45,41043,C. elegans genetic background modifies the core transcriptional response in an a-synuclein model of Parkinson’s disease,"Accumulation of protein aggregates is a major cause of Parkinsons disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative condition that is one of the most common causes of dementia. Transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans worms expressing the human synaptic protein -synuclein show inclusions of aggregated protein and replicate the defining pathological hallmarks of PD. It is however not known how PD progression and pathology differs among individual genetic backgrounds. Here, we compared gene expression patterns, and investigated the phenotypic consequences of transgenic -synuclein expression in five different C. elegans genetic backgrounds. Transcriptome analysis indicates that the effects of -synuclein expression on pathways associated with nutrient storage, lipid transportation and ion exchange depend on the genetic background. The gene expression changes we observe suggest that a range of phenotypes will be affected by -synuclein expression. We experimentally confirm this, showing that the transgenic lines generally show delayed development, reduced lifespan, and an increased rate of matricidal hatching. These phenotypic effects coincide with the core changes in gene expression, linking developmental arrest, mobility, metabolic and cellular repair mechanisms to -synuclein expression. Together, our results show both genotype-specific effects and core alterations in global gene expression and in phenotype in response to -synuclein. We conclude that the PD effects are substantially modified by the genetic background, illustrating that genetic background mechanisms should be elucidated to understand individual variation in PD.","Wang, Y.

46,41204,Targeting integrin alpha5 receptor in pancreatic stellate cells to diminish tumor-promoting effects in pancreatic cancer,"Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are the main precursors of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), known to induce cancer aggressiveness. Integrin alpha5 (ITGA5), a fibronectin receptor, was found to be overexpressed by CAFs in stroma and linked to poor overall survival (log-rank p=0.022, n=137) of patients with PDAC. In vitro, knockdown of ITGA5 in human PSCs (hPSCs) inhibited their adhesion, migration, and proliferation and also inhibited TGF-{beta}-mediated differentiation. In vivo, co-injection of PANC-1 tumor cells and hPSCs (sh-ITGA5) developed tumors with reduced fibrosis and slower growth rate compared to those composed of PANC-1 and hPSC (sh-Ctrl). Furthermore, we developed a ITGA5-antagonizing peptidomimetic (AV3) which inhibited TGF{beta}-mediated hPSC differentiation by blocking ITGA5/FAK pathway. In vivo, treatment with AV3 intraperitoneally attenuated tumor fibrosis and thereby enhanced the efficacy of gemcitabine in patient-derived xenografts in mice. Altogether, this study reports the therapeutic importance of ITGA5 in PDAC and provides novel therapeutic peptidomimetic to enhance the effect of chemotherapy.","Kuninty, P.; Bansal, R.; De Geus, S.; Schnittert, J.; Van Baarlen, J.; Storm, G.; Bijlsma, M.; Van Laarhoven, H.; Kuppen, P.; Vahrmeijer, A.; Ostman, A.; Sier, C.; Prakash, J.",19/06/2018,Cancer Biology,10.1101/350678,1,Jai Prakash,University of Twente,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/350678v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/350678v1.full.pdf,cc_no,NA,
47,41471,TGF-ßRII knock-down promotes tumor growth and chemoresistance to gemcitabine of pancreatic cancer cells via phosphorylation of STAT3,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most deadly cancers in the western countries because of a lack of early diagnostic markers and efficient therapeutics. At the time of diagnosis, more than 80% of patients have metastasis or locally advanced cancer and are therefore not eligible for surgical resection. Pancreatic cancer cell also harbour a high resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs such as gemcitabine that is one of the main palliative treatment for PDAC.\n\nTGF-{beta} possesses both tumor-suppressive and oncogenic activities in pancreatic cancer. TGF-{beta} signalling pathway plays complex role during carcinogenesis by initially inhibiting epithelial growth and later promoting the progression of advanced tumors and thus emerged as tumor suppressor pathway. TGF-{beta} binds to its receptor TGF-{beta}RII and activates different pathways: canonical pathway involving the Smad proteins and alternative pathways such as MAPKs. Smad4 is mutated in 50-80% of PDAC. Mutations of TGF-{beta}RII also occurs (5-10%). In order to decipher the role of TGF-{beta} in carcinogenesis and chemoresistance, we decided to characterize the knocking down of TGF-{beta}RII that is the first actor of TGF-{beta} signalling. We developed pancreatic cancer cell lines stably invalidated for TGF-{beta}RII and studied the impact on biological properties of pancreatic cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. We show that TGF-{beta}RII silencing alters tumor growth and migration as well as resistance to. TGF-{beta}RII silencing also leads to S727 STAT3 and S-63 c-Jun phosphorylation, decrease of MRP3 and increase of MRP4 ABC transporter expression and induction of a partial EMT phenotype.\n\nIn the future, the better understanding TGF-{beta} signaling pathways and underlying cellular mechanisms in chemoresistance to gemcitabine may bring new therapeutic tools to clinicians.","Drubay, V.; Skrypek, N.; Cordiez, L.; Vasseur, R.; Schulz, C.; Boukrout, N.; Duchene, B.; Coppin, L.; Van Seuningen, I.; Jonckheere, N.",21/06/2018,Cancer Biology,10.1101/352963,1,Nicolas Jonckheere,Inserm UMR-S1172/JPARC,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/352963v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/352963v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.3390/cancers10080254,
48,41554,L-norvaline reverses cognitive decline and synaptic loss in a murine model of Alzheimer’s disease,"The urea cycle plays a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). Arginase-I accumulation at sites of amyloid-beta deposition is associated with L-arginine deprivation and neurodegeneration. Moreover, a positive interaction between the arginase-II and mTOR-S6K1 pathways promote inflammation and oxidative stress. In this study, we treated 3xTg-AD mice exhibiting increased ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) activity and wild-type (WT) mice with L-norvaline. The substance combines unique properties of arginase and S6K1 inhibition. The treated 3xTg-AD mice demonstrated significantly improved acquisition of spatial memory, associated with a substantial reduction of microgliosis and shift from activated to resting phenotype. Moreover, an increase of dendritic spines density and escalation of the expression rates of neuroplasticity related proteins were followed by a decline in the levels of amyloid-beta toxic oligomeric and fibrillar species in the hippocampus. Our findings associate local amyloid-beta-driven and immune-mediated response with altered L-arginine metabolism and suggest that arginase and S6K1 inhibition by L-norvaline can delay progression of AD.","Polis, B.; Srikanth, K.

50,43627,Increased H-Bond Stability Relates to Altered e-Cleavage Efficiency and Aß Levels in the I45T Familial Alzheimer’s Disease Mutant of APP,"Cleavage of the amyloid precursor proteins (APP) transmembrane domain (TMD) by {gamma}-secretase is a crucial step in the aetiology of Alzheimers Disease (AD). Mutations in the APP TMD alter cleavage and lead to familial forms of AD (FAD). The majority of FAD mutations shift the preference of initial cleavage from {varepsilon}49 to {varepsilon}48, thus raising the AD-related A{beta}42/A{beta}40 ratio. The I45T mutation is among the few FAD mutations that do not alter {varepsilon}-site preference, while it dramatically reduces the efficiency of {varepsilon}-cleavage. Here, we investigate the impact of the I45T mutation on the backbone dynamics of the substrate TMD. Amide exchange experiments and molecular dynamics simulations in solvent and a lipid bilayer reveal an increased stability of amide hydrogen bonds at the {zeta}-and {gamma}-cleavage sites. Stiffening of the H-bond network is caused by an additional H-bond between the T45 side chain and the TMD backbone, which alters dynamics within the cleavage domain. In particular, the increased H-bond stability inhibits an upward movement of the {varepsilon}-sites in the I45T mutant. Thus, an altered presentation of {varepsilon}-sites to the active site of {gamma}-secretase as a consequence of restricted local flexibility provides a rationale for reduced {varepsilon}-cleavage efficiency of the I45T mutant.","Go¨tz, A.; Ho¨gel, P.; Silber, M.; Chaitoglou, I.; Luy, B.; Muhle-Goll, C.; Scharnagl, C.; Langosch, D.",04/08/2018,Biophysics,10.1101/372698,3,Dieter Langosch,"Technical University of Munich, Lehrstuhl Chemie der Biopolymere & CIPSM",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/372698v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/372698v3.full.pdf,cc_by_nd,10.1038/s41598-019-41766-1,
51,44877,Lipid associated polygenic enrichment in Alzheimer’s disease,"Cardiovascular (CV) and lifestyle associated risk factors (RFs) are increasingly recognized as important for Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis. Beyond the [isin]4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE), comparatively little is known about whether CV associated genes also increase risk for AD (genetic pleiotropy). Using large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) (total n > 500,000 cases and controls) and validated tools to quantify genetic pleiotropy, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with AD and one or more CV RFs, namely body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD), waist hip ratio (WHR), total cholesterol (TC), low-density (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In fold enrichment plots, we observed robust genetic enrichment in AD as a function of plasma lipids (TC, LDL, and HDL); we found minimal AD genetic enrichment conditional on BMI, T2D, CAD, and WHR. Beyond APOE, at conjunction FDR < 0.05 we identified 57 SNPs on 19 different chromosomes that were jointly associated with AD and CV outcomes including APOA4, ABCA1, ABCG5, LIPG, and MTCH2/SPI1. We found that common genetic variants influencing AD are associated with multiple CV RFs, at times with a different directionality of effect. Expression of these AD/CV pleiotropic genes was enriched for lipid metabolism processes, over-represented within astrocytes and vascular structures, highly co-expressed, and differentially altered within AD brains. Beyond APOE, we show that the polygenic component of AD is enriched for lipid associated RFs. Rather than a single causal link between genetic loci, RF and the outcome, we found that common genetic variants influencing AD are associated with multiple CV RFs. Our collective findings suggest that a network of genes involved in lipid biology also influence Alzheimers risk.","Broce, I.; Tan, C. H.; Fan, C.

52,46157,Evolutionary history of Alzheimer Disease causing protein family Presenilins with pathological implications.,"Presenilin proteins are type II transmembrane proteins. They make the catalytic component of Gamma secretase, a multiportion transmembrane protease. Amyloid protein, Notch and beta catenin are among more than 90 substrates of Presenilins. Mutations in Presenilins lead to defects in proteolytic cleavage of its substrate resulting in some of the most devastating pathological conditions including Alzheimer disease (AD), developmental disorders and cancer. In addition to catalytic roles, Presenilin protein is also shown to be involved in many non-catalytic roles i.e. calcium homeostasis, regulation of autophagy and protein trafficking etc. These proteolytic proteins are highly conserved, present in almost all the major eukaryotic groups. Studies on wide variety of organisms ranging from human to unicellular dictyostelium have shown the important catalytic and non-catalytic roles of Presenilins. In the current research project, we aimed to elucidate the phylogenetic history of Presenilins. We showed that Presenilins are the most ancient of the Gamma secretase proteins and might have their origin in last common eukaryotic ancestor (LCEA). We also demonstrated that these proteins have been evolving under strong purifying selection. Through evolutionary trace analysis, we showed that Presenilin protein sites which undergoes mutations in Familial Alzheimer Disease are highly conserved in metazoans. Finally, we discussed the evolutionary, physiological and pathological implication of our findings and proposed that evolutionary profile of Presenilins supports the loss of function hypothesis of AD pathogenesis.","Khan, A.

53,46049,Whole brain imaging reveals distinct spatial patterns of amyloid beta deposition in three mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease,"A variety of Alzheimers disease (AD) mouse models overexpress mutant forms of human amyloid precursor protein (APP), producing high levels of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) and forming plaques However, the degree to which these models mimic spatiotemporal patterns of A{beta} deposition in brains of AD patients is unknown. Here, we mapped the spatial distribution of A{beta} plaques across ages in three APP-overexpression mouse lines (APP/PS1, Tg2576, hAPP-J20) using in vivo labeling with methoxy-X04, high throughput whole brain imaging, and an automated informatics pipeline. Images were acquired with high resolution serial 2-photon tomography and labeled plaques were detected using custom-built segmentation algorithms. Image series were registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework, a 3D reference atlas, enabling automated brain-wide quantification of plaque density, number, and location. In both APP/PS1 and Tg2576 mice, plaques were identified first in isocortex, followed by olfactory, hippocampal, and cortical subplate areas. In hAPP-J20 mice, plaque density was highest in hippocampal areas, followed by isocortex, with little to no involvement of olfactory or cortical subplate areas. Within the major brain divisions, distinct regions were identified with high (or low) plaque accumulation; e.g., the lateral visual area within the isocortex of APP/PS1 mice had relatively higher plaque density compared with other cortical areas, while in hAPP-J20 mice, plaques were densest in the ventral retrosplenial cortex. In summary, we show how whole brain imaging of amyloid pathology in mice reveals the extent to which a given model recapitulates the regional A{beta} deposition patterns described in AD.","Whitesell, J.

54,47000,Microglial Heterogeneity in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease: A Mass Cytometry Analysis,"Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, have been subject to intense scrutiny recently because of their implicated role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease, as well as many other neurological conditions. However, little is known about the diversity of microglial phenotypes, apart from the clear recognition that the M1-M2 distinction is an oversimplification. We used mass cytometry, a high dimensional analog of flow cytometry involving mass spectrometry-based analyses of single cells bound with metal-tagged antibodies, to characterize the diversity of microglia isolated from the brains of 3xTg-AD mice at 12, 18, and 24 months of age. Antibodies to microglial surface antigens CD11b, CD11c, CD14, CD18, CD24, CD35, CD38, CD45, CD51, CD64, CD68, CD86, CD124, CD172a, CD200R, CD206, CD274, CD301, CX3CR1, F4-80, MERTK, MHC class II, Siglec F, and TLR4 as well as intracellular antigens Arginase-1, IL10, IL12p40, iNOS, NADPH Oxidase, TGF-beta, and TNF-alpha were conjugated to unique metal isotopes, and used for mass cytometry. Phenograph-based clustering of the resulting high dimensional datasets identified 28 cell clusters of widely varying sizes, including clearly discrete phenotypes as well as pseudo-continuous/fractal phenotypic diversity. Monte Carlo simulations involving random reshuffling of the datasets revealed very different and much more uniform clustering patterns. Furthermore, control analyses of mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cells and brain microglia using the same markers revealed largely disjoint clusterings, indicating that these microglial clusters were not the result of peripheral blood contamination. Most of the microglial clusters were similar in samples from 3xTg-AD mice at all 3 ages, as well as from 12-month-old wild-type mice. The largest cluster expressed high levels of canonical microglial markers CD11b, CD11c, CD18, CD64, CD68, CD200R, CX3CR1, F4-80, NADPH oxidase, and TGF-beta but did not vary between experimental groups. However, 3 clusters did differ across experimental groups, one of which increased significantly with age in the 3xTg-AD mice as a fraction of the total microglial population. This cluster expressed high levels of CD18, CD38, CD45, CD86, and CD200R, but not other canonical markers. In summary, these mass cytometry-based analyses revealed previously uncharacterized microglial phenotypic heterogeneity in a mouse model of Alzheimers disease. The specific roles of the putative subclasses of microglia, their relevance to human disease, and many other questions remain to be addressed.","Fountain, E. M.; Esparza, T. J.; Malkova, O.; Oh, S.

55,61167,Energy-dependent transport at dural lymphatic vessels is necessary for Aß brain clearance in Alzheimer's disease,"Viewed as an imbalance between production and clearance of toxic A{beta} peptides, Alzheimers disease is a candidate for therapies to augment brain waste removal. Prior work has shown that A{beta} accumulates in meninges with aging as a byproduct of normal brain activity, in parallel with build-up of A{beta} oligomers in neurons, blood vessels, and interstitial fluid. Using the TgF344-AD rat model of Alzheimers disease, we now report that dural lymphatic vessels specifically accumulate neurotoxic pyroglutamate amyloid beta (pE3-A{beta}) with aging. Notably, accelerated amyloidosis is observed in meninges after ligation of cervical lymphatics, together with significantly increased pE3-A{beta} and A{beta}42 deposition in upstream brain regions implicated in Alzheimers disease. Blockade of lymphatic clearance is not sufficiently compensated by other efflux pathways, suggesting a necessary role of A{beta} clearance at the level of lymphatics. We further report that dural lymphatic cells actively clear A{beta} via energy-dependent mechanisms, and lymphatic A{beta} transport is significantly impaired both in normal aging and in Alzheimers disease. Dural lymphatic cells isolated from the TgF344-AD rat show ultrastructural abnormalities in mitochondria and abnormal cytoplasmic inclusions, with a distinct transcriptional profile implicating failure of energy-dependent transport. Finally, using human meninges treated with FocusDeep tissue clearing, we demonstrate using whole mount panoramic imaging that dural lymphatic vessels comprise a structurally diverse intracranial vascular network that accumulates pE3-A{beta} with aging, similar to the rat model. We conclude that intracranial meningeal and extracranial cervical lymphatic vessels are targets for Alzheimers disease therapies focused on improving amyloid clearance.

56,49589,Evolution of embryo implantation was enabled by the origin of decidual cells in eutherian mammals,"Embryo implantation is the first step in the establishment of pregnancy in eutherian (Placental) mammals. Although viviparity evolved prior to the common ancestor of marsupials and eutherian mammals (therian ancestor), implantation is unique to eutherians. The ancestral therian pregnancy likely involved a short phase of attachment between the fetal and maternal tissues followed by parturition rather than implantation, similar to the mode of pregnancy found in marsupials such as the opossum. Embryo implantation in eutherian mammals as well as embryo attachment in opossum, induce a homologous inflammatory response in the uterus. Here, we elucidate the evolutionary mechanism by which the ancestral inflammatory fetal-maternal attachment was transformed into the process of implantation. We performed a comparative transcriptomic and immunohistochemical study of the gravid and non-gravid uteri of two eutherian mammals, armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) and hyrax (Procavia capensis); a marsupial outgroup, opossum (Monodelphis domestica); and compared it to previously published data on rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). This taxon sampling allows inference of the eutherian ancestral state. Our results show that in the eutherian lineage, the ancestral inflammatory response was domesticated by suppressing a detrimental component viz. signaling by the cytokine IL17A, while retaining components that are beneficial to placentation, viz. angiogenesis, vascular permeability, remodeling of extracellular matrix. IL17A mediates recruitment of neutrophils to inflamed mucosal tissues, which, if unchecked, can damage the uterus as well as the embryo and lead to expulsion of the fetus. We hypothesized that the uterine decidual stromal cells, which evolved coincidentally with embryo implantation, evolved, in part, to prevent IL17A-mediated neutrophil infiltration. We tested a prediction of this hypothesis in vitro, and showed that decidual stromal cells can suppress differentiation of human naive T cells into IL17A-producing Th17 cells. Together, these results provide a mechanistic understanding of early stages of the evolution of the eutherian mode of pregnancy, and also identify a potentially ancestral function of an evolutionary novelty, the decidual stromal cell-type.","Chavan, A.

We investigated the metabolomics of age and sex using longitudinal plasma samples from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimers Prevention (WRAP), a cohort of participants who were dementia free at enrollment. Metabolomic profiles were quantified for 2,316 fasting plasma samples among 1,187 participants, each with up to three study visits. Of 1,097 metabolites tested, 608 (55.4%) were associated with age and 680 (62.0%) with sex after correcting for multiple testing. Approximately twice as many metabolites were associated with age in stratified analyses of women versus men, and 63 metabolite trajectories significantly differed by sex, most notably including sphingolipids, which tended to increase in women and decrease in men with age. Using genome-wide genotyping, we also report the heritabilities of metabolites investigated, which ranged dramatically (0.2-99.2%); however, the median heritability of 36.2% suggests that many metabolites are highly influenced by a complex combination of genomic and environmental influences. These findings offer a more profound description of the aging process and may inform many new hypotheses regarding the role metabolites play in healthy and accelerated aging.","Darst, B.

Here we investigate whether systematic analysis of other members of this mouse amyloid-responsive network predicts other Alzheimers risk loci. This statistical comparison of the mouse amyloid-response network with Alzheimers disease genome-wide association studies identifies 5 other genetic risk loci for the disease (OAS1, CXCL10, LAPTM5, ITGAM and LILRB4).

Principal component analysis with factor rotation was used for dimension reduction of TG species. Differences in principal components between diagnostic groups and associations between principal components and AD biomarkers (including CSF, MRI and [18F]FDG-PET) were assessed using a multivariate generalized linear model (GLM) approach. In both cases, the Bonferroni method of adjustment was employed to correct for multiple comparisons.\n\nResultsThe 84 TGs yielded 9 principal components, two of which consisting of long-chain, polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing TGs (PUTGs), were significantly associated with MCI and AD.

The current state of the art in training machines to classify wildlife species from camera-trap data is to employ convolutional neural networks (CNN) encoded within deep learning algorithms. Here we report on results obtained in training a CNN to classify 20 African wildlife species with an overall accuracy of 87.5% from a dataset containing 111,467 images. We then used a gradient-weighted class-activation-mapping (Grad-CAM) procedure to extract the most salient pixels in the final convolution layer. We show that these pixels highlight features in particular images that are in most, but not all, cases similar to those used to train humans to identify these species. Further, we used mutual information methods to identify the neurons in the final convolution layer that consistently respond most strongly across a set of images of one particular species, and we then interpret the features in the image where the strongest responses occur. We also used hierarchical clustering of feature vectors (i.e., the state of the final fully-connected layer in the CNN) associated with each image to produce a visual similarity dendrogram of identified species. Finally, we evaluated how images that were not part of the training set fell within our dendrogram when these images were one of the 20 species \""known\"" to our CNN in contrast to where they fell when these images were \""unknown\"" to our CNN.","Miao, Z.; Gaynor, K.

62,51802,Bayesian reassessment of the epigenetic architecture of complex traits,"1Epigenetic DNA modification is partly under genetic control, and occurs in response to a wide range of environmental exposures. Linking epigenetic marks to clinical outcomes may provide greater insight into underlying molecular processes of disease, assist in the identification of therapeutic targets, and improve risk prediction. Here, we present a statistical approach, based on Bayesian inference, that estimates associations between disease risk and all measured epigenetic probes jointly, automatically controlling for both data structure (including cell-count effects, relatedness, and experimental batch effects) and correlations among probes. We benchmark our approach in simulation study, finding improved estimation of probe associations across a wide range of scenarios over existing approaches. Our method estimates the total proportion of disease risk captured by epigenetic probe variation, and when we applied it to measures of body mass index (BMI) and cigarette consumption behaviour in 5,101 individuals, we find that 66.7% (95% CI 60.0-72.8) of the variation in BMI and 67.7% (95% CI 58.4-76.9) of the variation in cigarette consumption can be captured by methylation array data from whole blood, independent of the variation explained by single nucleotide polymorphism markers. We find novel associations, with smoking behaviour associated with a methylation probe at the MNDA gene with >95% posterior inclusion probability, which is a myeloid cell nuclear differentiation antigen gene previously implicated as a biomarker for inflammation and non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk. We conduct unique genome-wide enrichment analyses, identifying blood cholesterol, lipid transport and sterol metabolism pathways for BMI, and response to xenobiotic stimulus and negative regulation of RNA polymerase II promoter transcription for smoking, all with >95% posterior inclusion probability of having methylation probes with associations >1.5 times larger than the average. Finally, we improve phenotypic prediction in two independent cohorts by 28.7% and 10.2% for BMI and smoking respectively over a LASSO model. These results imply that probe measures may capture large amounts of variance because they are likely a consequence of the phenotype rather than a cause. As a result, 'omics' data may enable accurate characterization of disease progression and identification of individuals who are on a path to disease. Our approach facilitates better understanding of the underlying epigenetic architecture of complex common disease and is applicable to any kind of genomics data.","Trejo Banos, D.; Mccartney, D.

63,53232,Ectopic expression induces abnormal somatodendritic distribution of tau in the mouse brain,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that is localized to the axon. In Alzheimers disease, the distribution of tau undergoes a remarkable alteration, leading to the formation of tau inclusions in the somatodendritic compartment. To investigate how this mis-localization occurs, we recently developed immunohistochemical techniques that can separately detect endogenous mouse and exogenous human tau with high sensitivity, which allows us to visualize not only the pathological but pre-aggregated tau in mouse brain tissues of both sex. In tau transgenic mouse brains, exogenous human tau was abundant in dendrites and somata even in the presymptomatic period, whereas the axonal localization of endogenous mouse tau was unaffected. In stark contrast, exogenous tau was properly localized to the axon in human tau knock-in mice. We tracked this difference to the temporal expression patterns of tau. Tau mRNA was continuously expressed in the transgenic mice, whereas endogenous tau and exogenous tau in the knock-in mice exhibited high expression levels during the neonatal period and strong suppression into the adulthood. These results indicated the uncontrolled expression of exogenous tau beyond the developmental period as a cause of mis-localization in the transgenic mice. Super-resolution microscopic and biochemical analyses also indicated that the interaction between microtubules and exogenous tau was indeed impaired in the tau transgenic mice. Thus, the ectopic expression of tau may be critical for its somatodendritic mis-localization, a key step of the tauopathy.\n\nSignificance StatementSomatodendritic localization of tau may be an early step leading to the neuronal degeneration in tauopathies. However, the mechanisms of the normal axonal distribution of tau and the mis-localization of pathological tau remain obscure. Our immunohistochemical and biochemical analyses demonstrated that the endogenous mouse tau is transiently expressed in neonatal brains, that exogenous human tau expressed corresponding to such tau expression profile can distribute into the axon, and that the constitutive expression of tau into adulthood (ex. human tau in Tg mice) results in abnormal somatodendritic localization. Thus, the expression profile of tau is tightly associated with the localization of tau, and the ectopic expression of tau in matured neurons may be involved in the pathogenesis of tauopathy.","Kubo, A.; Ueda, S.; Yamane, A.; Wada-Kakuda, S.; Matsuyama, M.; Nomori, A.; Takashima, A.; Goto, M.; Ito, M.; Tomiyama, T.; Mori, H.; Ihara, Y.; Misonou, H.; Miyasaka, T.",06/11/2018,Neuroscience,10.1101/457853,1,Tomohiro Miyasaka,"Department of Neuropathology, Faculty of Life and Medical Sciences, Doshisha University",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/457853v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/457853v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2845-18.2019,
64,52894,"Differential Signaling Mediated by ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4 in Human Neurons Parallels Alzheimer’s Disease Risk","Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) mediates clearance of circulating lipoproteins from blood by binding to ApoE receptors. Humans express three genetic variants, ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4, that exhibit distinct ApoE receptor binding properties. In brain, ApoE is abundantly produced by activated astrocytes and microglia, and three variants differentially affect Alzheimers disease (AD), such that ApoE2 protects against, and ApoE4 predisposes to the disease. A role for ApoE4 in driving microglial dysregulation and impeding A{beta} clearance in AD is well documented, but the direct effects of three variants on neurons are poorly understood. Extending previous studies, we here demonstrate that ApoE variants differentially activate multiple neuronal signaling pathways and regulate synaptogenesis. Specifically, using human neurons cultured in the absence of glia to exclude indirect glial mechanisms, we show that ApoE broadly stimulates signal transduction cascades which among others enhance synapse formation with an ApoE4>ApoE3>ApoE2 potency rank order, paralleling the relative risk for AD conferred by these variants. Unlike the previously described induction of APP transcription, however, ApoE-induced synaptogenesis involves CREB rather than cFos activation. We thus propose that in brain, ApoE acts as a glia-secreted paracrine signal and activates neuronal signaling pathways in what may represent a protective response, with the differential potency of ApoE variants causing distinct levels of chronic signaling that may contribute to AD pathogenesis.","Huang, Y.-W.

65,53378,BIN1 recovers tauopathy-induced long-term memory deficits in mice and interacts with Tau through Thr348 phosphorylation,"The bridging integrator 1 gene (BIN1) is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). In this report, we investigated how BIN1-dependent pathophysiological processes might be associated with Tau. We first generated a cohort of control and transgenic mice either overexpressing human MAPT (TgMAPT) or both human MAPT and BIN1 (TgMAPT;TgBIN1), which we followed-up from 3 to 15 months. In TgMAPT;TgBIN1 mice short-term memory deficits appeared earlier than in TgMAPT mice; however - unlike TgMAPT mice - TgMAPT;TgBIN1 mice did not exhibit any long-term or spatial memory deficits for at least 15 months. After sacrifice of the cohort at 18 months, immunohistochemistry revealed that BIN1 overexpression prevents both Tau mislocalization and somatic inclusion in the hippocampus, where an increase in BIN1-Tau interaction was also observed. We then sought mechanisms controlling the BIN1-Tau interaction. We developed a high-content screening approach to characterize modulators of the BIN1-Tau interaction in an agnostic way (1,126 compounds targeting multiple pathways), and we identified - among others - an inhibitor of Calcineurin, a Ser/Thr phosphatase. We determined that Calcineurin dephosphorylates BIN1 on a Cyclin-dependent kinase phosphorylation site at T348, promoting the open conformation of the neuronal BIN1 isoform. Phosphorylation of this site increases the availability of the BIN1 SH3 domain for Tau interaction, as demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance experiments and in primary neurons. Finally, we observed that the levels of the neuronal BIN1 isoform were decreased in AD brains, whereas phospho-BIN1(T348):BIN1 ratio was increased, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. In conclusion, our data support the idea that BIN1 modulates the AD risk through an intricate regulation of its interaction with Tau. Alteration in BIN1 expression or activity may disrupt this regulatory balance with Tau and have direct effects on learning and memory.","Sartori, M.; Mendes, T.; Desai, S.; Lasorsa, A.; Herldean, A.; Malmanche, N.; Makinen, P.; Marttinen, M.; Malki, I.; Chapuis, J.; Flaig, A.; Vreulx, A.-C.; Amouyel, P.; Leroux, F.; Deprez, B.; Cantrelle, F.-X.; Marechal, D.; Pradier, L.; Hiltunen, M.; Landrieu, I.; Kilinc, D.; Herault, Y.; Laporte, J.; Lambert, J.-C.",08/11/2018,Neuroscience,10.1101/462317,2,Jean-Charles Lambert,"INSERM, U1167, Institut Pasteur de Lille, University of Lille, Lille, France",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/462317v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/462317v2.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1007/s00401-019-02017-9,

Hippocampal theta oscillations that are critical in spatial navigation, learning and memory are impaired in AD. Since GABAergic interneurons, such as somatostatin-positive (SST+) and parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons, are believed to play key roles in the hippocampal oscillogenesis, we asked whether A{beta}O selectively impairs these SST+ and PV+ interneurons. To selectively manipulate SST+ or PV+ interneuron activity in mice with A{beta}O pathology in vivo, we co-injected A{beta}O and adeno-associated virus (AAV) for expressing floxed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) into the hippocampus of SST-Cre or PV-Cre mice. Local field potential (LFP) recordings in vivo in these A{beta}O-injected mice showed a reduction in the peak power of theta oscillations and desynchronization of spikes from CA1 pyramidal neurons relative to theta oscillations compared to those in control mice. Optogenetic-activation of SST+ but not PV+ interneurons in A{beta}O-injected mice fully restored the peak power of theta oscillations and resynchronized the theta spike phases to a level observed in control mice. In vitro whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices treated with A{beta}O revealed that short-term plasticity of SST+ interneuron inhibitory inputs to CA1 pyramidal neurons at theta frequency were selectively disrupted while that of PV+ interneuron inputs were unaffected. Together, our results suggest that dysfunction in inputs from SST+ interneurons to CA1 pyramidal neurons may underlie the impairment of theta oscillations observed in A{beta}O-injected mice in vivo. Our findings identify SST+ interneurons as a target for restoring theta-frequency oscillations in early AD.","Chung, H.; Park, K.; Jang, H. J.; Kohl, M.

We introduce BADGERS, a powerful method to perform polygenic score-based biobank-wide scans for disease-trait associations. Compared to traditional regression approaches, BADGERS uses GWAS summary statistics as input and does not require multiple traits to be measured on the same cohort. We applied BADGERS to two independent datasets for Alzheimers disease (AD; N=61,212). Among the polygenic risk scores (PRS) for 1,738 traits in the UK Biobank, we identified 48 significant trait PRSs associated with AD after adjusting for multiple testing. Family history, high cholesterol, and numerous traits related to intelligence and education showed strong and independent associations with AD. Further, we identified 41 significant PRSs associated with AD endophenotypes. While family history and high cholesterol were strongly associated with neuropathologies and cognitively-defined AD subgroups, only intelligence and education-related traits predicted pre-clinical cognitive phenotypes. These results provide novel insights into the distinct biological processes underlying various risk factors for AD.","Yan, D.; Hu, B.; Darst, B. F.; Mukherjee, S.; Kunkle, B.

Exosomes were shown to act as neuroinflammatory mediators involved in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers disease (AD), Parkinsons disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Brain aging has been associated to increased neuroinflammation. In addition, a decreased extracellular vesicle concentration was observed in aging tissues. The specific mechanisms how exosomes and aging are connected are not known yet.\n\nResultsHere we have shown that peripheral injection had almost no effect on selected gene expression in the liver. However, exosome injection has led to changes in the specific markers of glial cell activation (CD68, Iba1, GFAP). Interestingly, only injection of exosomes isolated from aged mice induced significant activation of astrocyte cells, as shown by increased GFAP expression.\n\nConclusionTranscription levels of genes GFAP, TGF-{beta}, CD68, Iba1 known to be involved in glial cell function are significantly changing after introduction of peripheral extracellular vesicles. Exosomes were able to pass blood brain barrier and induce glial cell activation. GFAP known to be a specific astrocyte activation marker was significantly higher expressed after injection of old but not young exosomes, indicating a possible role of exosomes in the mechanisms of brain aging.","Morales-Prieto, D.

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between APOE genotype and the gut microbiome composition in human and APOE-targeted replacement (TR, APOE3 and APOE4) transgenic mice. Faecal microbiota amplicon sequencing from matched individuals with different APOE genotypes revealed no significant differences in overall microbiota diversity (alpha or beta diversity) in group-aggregated human APOE genotypes. However, several bacterial taxa showed significantly different relative abundance between APOE genotypes. Notably, we detected an association of Prevotellaceae and Ruminococcaceae and several butyrate-producing genera abundances with APOE genotypes. These findings were confirmed by comparing the gut microbiota of APOE-TR mice. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis of faecal water from murine samples detected significant differences in microbe-associated amino acids and short-chain fatty acids between APOE genotypes. Together, the findings indicate that APOE genotype associated with specific gut microbiome profiles in both humans and in APOE-TR mice. This suggests that the gut microbiome is worth further investigation as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate the deleterious impact of the APOE4 allele on cognitive decline and the prevention and treatment of AD.","Tran, T.

However, molecular mechanism of the apoE-A{beta} interaction is poorly understood. Here we characterize the nature of the apoE-A{beta} complexes and identify the region of apoE that interacts with A{beta}. We have prepared three distinct fragments of apoE4, viz., the N-terminal fragment (NTF), hinge domain fragment (HDF) and C-terminal fragment (CTF) to compare its interactions with A{beta}. Kinetics of aggregation of A{beta} is delayed dramatically in presence of low, substoichiometric concentrations of both NTF and CTF in lipid-free, as well as, in lipidated forms. Effect of HDF is found to be small. Strong inhibition by NTF and CTF at substoichiometric concentrations indicate interactions with the  intermediates or the oligomers of A{beta}. Kinetics of Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between full-length apoE4 labeled with EDANS at positions 62, 139, 210, 247, and 276 and tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)-labeled A{beta} further support involvement of multiple regions of apoE in the interactions. Since the interactions involve intermediates of A{beta} quantitative evaluation of the binding affinities are not feasible. Hence we employed a competitive binding assay to examine whether the N- and C-terminal domains interact cooperatively. Addition of unlabeled full-length apoE eliminates the FRET between EDANS-NTF + EDANS-CTF and TMR-A{beta} almost completely but not vice versa. Furthermore, full-length apoE but not the equimolar mixture of the fragments could displace the already bound EDANS-apoE molecules from the complexes. Therefore, binding affinity of the A{beta} oligomers to the intact full-length apoE is much higher than the affinity to the domains when mixed together as fragments. Thus, our results indicate that apoE-A{beta} complex formation is mediated by positively cooperative multivalent binding between the multiple sites on apoE and the oligomeric forms of A{beta}.","Garai, K.; Ghosh, S.; Sil, T.

71,55184,APOE4 is Associated with Differential Regional Vulnerability to Bioenergetic Deficits in Aged APOE Mice,"The {varepsilon}4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the dominant genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimers disease (AD). However, the reason for the association between APOE4 and AD remains unclear. While much of the research has focused on the ability of the apoE4 protein to increase the aggregation and decrease the clearance of A{beta}, there is also an abundance of data showing that APOE4 negatively impacts many additional processes in the brain, including bioenergetics. In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the APOE4s role in AD pathogenesis, we performed a multi-omic analysis of APOE4 vs. APOE3 expression in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and primary visual cortex (PVC) of aged APOE mice. These studies revealed region-specific alterations in several bioenergetic pathways, including oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), the TCA-cycle and fatty acid metabolism. Follow-up analysis utilizing the Seahorse platform revealed decreased mitochondrial respiration in the hippocampus and cortex of aged APOE4 vs. APOE3 mice, but not in the EC of these mice. Additional studies, as well as the original multi-omic data suggest that bioernergetic pathways in the EC of aged APOE mice may be differentially regulated by APOE4 expression. Given the importance of the EC as one of the first regions to be affected by AD pathology in humans, this differential bionenergetic regulation observed in the EC vs. other brain regions of aged APOE4 mice may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD, particularly among APOE4 carriers.","Nuriel, T.; Larrea, D.; Guilfoyle, D.

72,55168,"Network-based identification of genetic factors in Ageing, lifestyle and Type 2 Diabetes that Influence in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease","MotivationAlzheimers disease (AD) is currently incurable and the causative risk factors are still poorly understood, which impedes development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. We propose a network-based quantitative framework to reveal details of the complex interaction between the various genetic contributors to AD susceptibility. We analyzed gene expression microarray data from tissues affected by AD, advanced ageing, high alcohol consumption, type II diabetes, high body fat, high dietary fat, obesity, high dietary red meat intake, sedentary lifestyle, smoking, and control datasets. We developed genetic associations and diseasome networks for these factors and AD using the neighborhood-based benchmarking and multilayer network topology approaches.\n\nResultsThe study identified 484 genes differentially expressed between AD and controls. Among these, 27 genes showed elevated expression both in individuals in AD and in smoker datasets; similarly 21 were observed in AD and type II diabetes datasets and 12 for AD and sedentary lifestyle datsets. However, AD shared less than ten such elevated expression genes with other factors examined. 3 genes, namely HLA-DRB4, IGH and IGHA2 showed increased expression among the AD, type II diabetes and alcohol consumption datasets; 2 genes, IGHD and IGHG1, were commonly up-regulated among the AD, type II diabetes, alcohol consumption and sedentary lifestyle datasets. Protein-protein interaction networks identified 10 hub genes: CREBBP, PRKCB, ITGB1, GAD1, GNB5, PPP3CA, CABP1, SMARCA4, SNAP25 and GRIA1. Ontological and pathway analyses genes, including Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and dbGaP databases were used for gold benchmark gene-disease associations to validate the significance of these putative target genes of AD progression.\n\nConclusionOur network-based methodologies have uncovered molecular pathways that may influence AD development, suggesting novel mechanisms that contribute to AD risk and which may form the basis of new therapeutic and diagnostic approaches.\n\nContactmohammad.moni@sydney.edu.au","Chowdhury, U.

73,55708,Exenatide reverts the high-fat-diet-induced impairment of BDNF signaling and inflammatory response in an animal model of Alzheimer’s disease,"Backgroundpreclinical, clinical, and epidemiological evidence support the notion that Alzheimers disease(AD) is a multifactorial condition in which, along with {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) and tau-related pathology, the synergistic activity of genetic, environmental, vascular, metabolic, and inflammatory factors promote the onset and progression of the disease. Epidemiological evidence indicate that glucose intolerance, deficits in insulin secretion or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) participate in increasing the risk of developing cognitive impairment or dementia. A pivotal role in the process is played by insulin as the hormone critically regulates brain functioning. GLP-1, the glucagon-like peptide 1, facilitates insulin signaling, regulates glucose homeostasis, and modulates synaptic plasticity. Exenatide is a GLP-1R agonist, characterized by an extended half-life, employed in T2DM. However, exenatide has also been shown to affect the signaling of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), synaptic plasticity, and cognitive performances in animal models of brain aging and neurodegeneration.\n\nMethodsin this study, we tested whether exenatide exerts neuroprotection in a preclinical AD model set to mimic the clinical complexity of the human disease. To that aim, we investigated the effects of 3-month exenatide treatment in 3xTg-AD mice challenged for six months with a high-fat diet (HFD). Endpoints of the study were variations in systemic metabolism, insulin and neurotrophic signaling, neuroinflammation, levels of A{beta} and tau pathology as well as changes in cognitive performances.\n\nFindings and interpretationresults of the study indicate that exenatide reverts the adverse changes of BDNF signaling and the neuroinflammation status of 3xTg-AD mice undergoing HFD.","Bomba, M.; Granzotto, A.; Castelli, V.; Lattanzio, R.; Cimini, A.; Sensi, S.

When combined, they contribute however to a highly predictive polygenic risk score. The relevance of these subthreshold risk genes to disease, and how their combined predictive power translates into functionally relevant disease pathways, is unknown. We investigate here at the genome-wide level and in an unbiased way to what extent AD risk genes show altered gene expression in the context of increasing A{beta} or Tau pathology in mouse models of AD.\n\nMethodsWe used an existing GWAS data set to generate lists of candidate AD genes at different levels of significance. We performed transcriptomic analysis on wild-type and transgenic APP/PS1 (APPtg) and Thy-TAU22 (TAUtg) mouse models at early and late stage of disease. We used unbiased weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify clusters of co-regulated genes responsive to A{beta} or TAU pathology. Gene set enrichment was used to identify clusters that were enriched for AD risk genes.\n\nFindingsConsistent and significant enrichment of AD risk genes was found in only one out of 63 coexpression modules. This module is highly responsive to A{beta} but not to TAU pathology. We identify in this module 18 AD risk genes (p-value=6{middle dot}5e-11) including 11 new ones, GPC2, TREML2, SYK, GRN, SLC2A5, SAMSN1, PYDC1, HEXB, RRBP1, LYN and BLNK. All are expressed in microglia, have a binding site for the transcription factor SPI1 (PU.1), and become significantly upregulated when exposed to A{beta}.

75,56954,Farnesyl Transferase Inhibition for the Treatment of Tauopathies,"Tau inclusions are a shared feature of many neurodegenerative conditions and tau mutations lead to frontotemporal dementia. Approaches to treatment of these conditions have focused directly on the tau protein by targeting its post-translational modifications, its levels and its tendency to aggregate. We discovered a novel regulatory pathway for tau degradation that operates through the Rhes protein, a GTPase. Rhes is farnesylated and treatment with the farnesyl transferase inhibitor, lonafarnib, reduced Rhes, attenuated behavioral abnormalities, significantly reduced atrophy, tau inclusions, sumoylation and ubiquitination, as well as microgliosis in the rTg4510 tauopathy mouse. Direct reduction of Rhes levels reproduced the results observed with lonafarnib. The mechanism of lonafarnib action, as mediated by Rhes to reduce tau pathology, operates through the lysosome without involvement of the proteasome. Finally we show that the developmental increase in Rhes levels can be homeostatically regulated in the presence of tau mutations as a protective mechanism through which cells sense abnormal tau before any pathology is present. The extensive human trials of lonafarnib for other conditions, makes this drug ideal for repurposing to treat tauopathies.\n\nOne-sentence summaryVia a mechanism that involves targeting Rhes, lonafarnib can induce lysosomal-mediated tau degradation and prevent pathology in a tau mouse model","Hernandez, I.; Luna, G.; Rauch, J.

Understanding the molecular pathology of AD during disease progression may identify new ways to reduce neuronal damage. Here, we present a longitudinal study tracking dynamic proteomic alterations in the brains of an inducible Drosophila melanogaster model of AD expressing the Arctic mutant A{beta}42 gene. We identified 3093 proteins from flies that were induced to express A{beta}42 and age-matched healthy controls using label-free quantitative ion-mobility data independent analysis mass spectrometry. Of these, 228 proteins were significantly altered by A{beta}42 accumulation and were enriched for AD-associated processes. Network analyses further revealed that these proteins have distinct hub and bottleneck properties in the brain protein interaction network, suggesting that several may have significant effects on brain function. Our unbiased analysis provides useful insights into the key processes governing the progression of amyloid toxicity and forms a basis for further functional analyses in model organisms and translation to mammalian systems.","Scholes, H.

A larger number of VRFs was associated with greater brain atrophy, lower grey matter volume, and poorer white matter health. Effect sizes were small (brain structural R2 [&le;] 1.8%). Higher aggregate vascular risk was related to multiple regional MRI hallmarks associated with dementia risk: lower frontal and temporal cortical volumes, lower subcortical volumes, higher white matter hyperintensity volumes, and poorer white matter microstructure in association and thalamic pathways. Smoking pack years, hypertension and diabetes showed the most consistent associations across all brain measures. Hypercholesterolaemia was not uniquely associated with any MRI marker.\n\nConclusionHigher levels of VRFs were associated with poorer brain health across grey and white matter macro- and microstructure. Effects are mainly additive, converging upon frontal and temporal cortex, subcortical structures, and specific classes of white matter fibres. Though effect sizes were small, these results emphasise the vulnerability of brain health to vascular factors even in relatively healthy middle and older age, and the potential to partly ameliorate cognitive decline by addressing these malleable risk factors.","Cox, S.

78,60957,Reconstructing and Analysing The Genome of The Last Eukaryote Common Ancestor to Better Understand the Transition from FECA to LECA.,"It is still a matter of debate whether the First Eukaryote Common Ancestor (FECA) arose from the merger of an archaeal host with an alphaproteobacterium, or was a proto-eukaryote with significant eukaryotic characteristics way before endosymbiosis occurred. The Last Eukaryote Common Ancestor (LECA) as its descendant is thought to be an entity that possessed functional and cellular complexity comparable to modern organisms. The precise nature and physiology of both of these organisms has been a long-standing, unanswered question in evolutionary and cell biology. Recently, a much broader diversity of eukaryotic genomes has become available and this means we can reconstruct early eukaryote evolution with a greater deal of precision. Here, we reconstruct a hypothetical genome for LECA from modern eukaryote genomes. The constituent genes were mapped onto 454 pathways from the KEGG database covering cellular, genetic, and metabolic processes across six model species to provide functional insights into its capabilities. We reconstruct a LECA that was a facultatively anaerobic, single-celled organism, similar to a modern Protist possessing complex predatory and sexual behaviour. We go on to examine how much of these capabilities arose along the FECA-to-LECA transition period. We see a at least 1,554 genes gained by FECA during this evolutionary period with extensive remodelling of pathways relating to lipid metabolism, cellular processes, genetic information processing, protein processing, and signalling. We extracted the BRITE classifications for the genes from the KEGG database, which arose during the transition from FECA-to-LECA and examine the types of genes that saw the most gains and what novel classifications were introduced. Two-thirds of our reconstructed LECA genome appears to be prokaryote in origin and the remaining third consists of genes with functional classifications that originate from prokaryote homologs in our LECA genome. Signal transduction and Post Translational Modification elements stand out as the primary novel classes of genes developed during this period. These results suggest that largely the eukaryote common ancestors achieved the defining characteristics of modern eukaryotes by primarily expanding on prokaryote biology and gene families.","Newman, D.; Whelan, F.; Moore, M.; Rusilowicz, M.; Mcinerney, J.

79,60991,Alzheimer’s disease clinical variants show distinct regional patterns of neurofibrillary tangle accumulation,"BackgroundNeurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology in Alzheimers disease (AD) follows a stereotypic progression well-characterized by Braak staging. However, some AD cases show deviations from the Braak staging scheme. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that these variations in the regional distribution of tau pathology are linked to heterogeneity in the clinical phenotypes of AD.

MethodsWe included a clinicopathological cohort of ninety-four AD cases enriched for atypical clinical presentations. Subjects underwent apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping and neuropsychological testing. Main cognitive domains (executive, visuospatial, language, and memory function) were assessed using an established composite z-score. We assessed NFT density and distribution from thioflavin S fluorescent microscopy throughout four neocortical and two hippocampal regions. A mathematical algorithm classifying AD cases into typical, hippocampal sparing (HpSp), and limbic predominant (LP) subtypes based on regional NFT burden was compared to unbiased hierarchical clustering for cases with Braak stage > IV.

ResultsPatients diagnosed with logopenic primary progressive aphasia showed significantly higher NFT density in the superior temporal gyrus relative to patients diagnosed with Alzheimer-type dementia (p = 0.0091), while patients with corticobasal syndrome showed significantly higher NFT density in the primary motor cortex (p = 0.0205). Hierarchical clustering identified three discrete clusters of patients characterized respectively by low overall NFT burden (n = 18), high overall burden (n = 30), and cortical-predominant burden (n = 24). A regionally specific effect was observed for visuospatial ability; higher NFT density in the angular gyrus ({beta} = - 0.0921, p = 0.0099) and in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus ({beta} = -0.0735, p = 0.0380) was significantly associated with more severe visuospatial dysfunction, modulated by age of death.

ConclusionsOur results suggest domain-specific functional consequences of regional NFT accumulation. In particular, we observed focal aggregation of NFT density in clinically relevant regions among different clinical AD variants. Continued work to map the regionally specific clinical consequences of tau accumulation presents an opportunity to increase understanding of disease mechanisms underlying atypical clinical manifestations.","Petersen, C.; Nolan, A.

81,61897,White matter changes in the perforant path in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and incurable motor neuron disease. Some ALS patients are affected by a level of cognitive or behavioural decline that meets the criteria for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). ALS and FTD share genetic and pathological features; for example, the deposition of phosphorylated 43 kDa TAR DNA-binding protein (pTDP-43) in the brain. Spreading of pTDP-43 pathology in ALS towards brain areas that connect via the Papez circuit is a possible indicator of progression towards FTD. For example, pTDP-43 aggregates in the granule cells of the hippocampus correlate well with clinically manifest FTD. Here, we test the hypothesis that white matter degeneration of the perforant path - as part of the Papez circuit - in the hippocampus is a feature of ALS, even in the absence of fully developed FTD or deposition of pTDP-43 inclusions in hippocampal granule cells. We used diffusion MRI (dMRI), polarized light imaging (PLI) and immunohistochemical analysis of hippocampus sections from controls (n=5) and ALS patients (n=14) to perform an in-depth study of white matter in the perforant path.

The dMRI results show a significant decrease in fractional anisotropy (p=0.01) and an increase in mean diffusivity (p=0.01), axial diffusivity (p=0.03) and radial diffusivity (p=0.03) in the perforant path in ALS patients compared to controls, possibly indicating a loss of white matter fibres. Myelin density (measured with PLI retardance) was lower in ALS patients compared to controls (p=0.05) and correlated with dMRI fractional anisotropy (r=0.52, p=0.03). The dMRI and PLI results were confirmed by the immunohistochemistry; both myelin (proteolipid protein, p=0.03) and neurofilaments (SMI-312, p=0.02) were lower in ALS patients. The activated microglial (CD68) density was similar in ALS and controls. Only two out of the fourteen ALS cases showed pTDP-43 pathology in the dentate gyrus; however, while these two ALS-FTD cases showed reduced myelination in the perforant path, the values were comparable to other ALS cases.

We conclude that degeneration of the perforant path occurs in ALS patients and that this may occur before, or independent of, pTDP-43 aggregation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. Future research should focus on correlating the degree of clinically observed cognitive decline to the amount of white matter atrophy in the perforant path.","Mollink, J.; Hiemstra, M.; Miller, K.

We used transgenic mice harbouring human tau (rTg4510) and amyloid precursor protein (J20) mutations to investigate transcriptional changes associated with the development of both tau and amyloid pathology. Using highly-parallel RNA sequencing we profiled transcriptional variation in the entorhinal cortex at four time points identifying robust genotype-associated differences in entorhinal cortex gene expression in both models. We quantified neuropathological burden across multiple brain regions in the same individual mice, identifying widespread changes in gene expression paralleling the development of tau pathology in rTg4510 mice. Differentially expressed transcripts included genes associated with familial AD from genetic studies of human patients, and genes annotated to both common and rare variants identified in GWAS and exome-sequencing studies of late-onset sporadic AD. Systems-level analyses identified discrete co-expression networks associated with the progressive accumulation of tau, with these enriched for genes and pathways previously implicated in the neuro-immunological and neurodegenerative processes driving AD pathology. Finally, we report considerable overlap between tau-associated networks and AD-associated co-expression modules identified in the human cortex. Our data provide further support for an immune-response component in the accumulation of tau, and reveal novel molecular pathways associated with the progression of AD neuropathology.","Castanho, I.; Murray, T.

83,61991,Unraveling ChR2-driven stochastic Ca2+ dynamics in astrocytes - A call for new interventional paradigms,"Control of astrocytes via modulation of Ca2+ oscillations using techniques like optogenetics can prove to be crucial in therapeutic intervention of a variety of neurological disorders. However, a systematic study quantifying the effect of optogenetic stimulation in astrocytes is yet to be performed. Here, we propose a novel stochastic Ca2+dynamics model that incorporates the light sensitive component - channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2). Utilizing this model, we studied the effect of various pulsed light stimulation paradigms on astrocytes for select variants of ChR2 (wild type, ChETA, and ChRET/TC) in both an individual and a network of cells. Our results exhibited a consistent pattern of Ca2+ activity among individual cells in response to optogenetic stimulation, i.e., showing steady state regimes with increased Ca2+ basal level and Ca2+ spiking probability. Furthermore, we performed a global sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of stochasticity and variation of model parameters on astrocytic Ca2+ dynamics in the presence and absence of light stimulation, respectively. Results indicated that directing variants towards the first open state of the photo-cycle of ChR2 (o1) enhances spiking activity in astrocytes during optical stimulation. Evaluation of the effect of astrocytic ChR2 expression (heterogeneity) on Ca2+ signaling revealed that the optimal stimulation paradigm of a network does not necessarily coincide with that of an individual cell. Simulation for ChETA-incorporated astrocytes suggest that maximal activity of a single cell reduced the spiking probability of the network of astrocytes at higher degrees of ChR2 expression efficiency due to an elevation of basal Ca2+ beyond physiological levels. Collectively, the framework presented in this study provides valuable information for the selection of light stimulation paradigms that elicit optimal astrocytic activity using existing ChR2 constructs, as well as aids in the engineering of future optogenetic constructs.

Author summaryOptogenetics - an avant-garde technique involves targeted delivery of light sensitive ion channels to cells. Channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2), an algal derived light sensitive ion channel has extensively been used in neuroscience to manipulate various cell types in a guided and controlled manner. Despite being predominantly used in neurons, recent advancements have led to the expansion of the application of optogenetics in non-neuronal cell types, like astrocytes. These cells play a key role in various aspects of the central nervous system and alteration of their signaling is associated with various disorders, including epilepsy, stroke and Alzheimers disease. Hence, invaluable information for therapeutic intervention can be obtained from using optogenetics to regulate astrocytic activity in a strategic manner. Here, we propose a novel computational model to assess astrocytic response to optogenetic stimulation which implicitly accounts for the stochastic character of Ca2+ signaling in this cell type. We identified light stimulation paradigms suitable for eliciting astrocytic Ca2+ response within physiological levels in widely-used ChR2 variants and identified highly sensitive parameters in ChR2 kinetics conducive for higher probability in Ca2+ spiking. Overall, the results of this model can be used to boost astrocyte light-induced behavior prediction and the development of improved future optogenetic constructs.","Moshkforoush, A.; Balachandar, L.; Moncion, C.; Santana, J.; Riera, J.",13/02/2019,Neuroscience,10.1101/549469,1,Jorge Riera,Florida International University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/549469v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/549469v1.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008648,
84,62435,Sets of Co-regulated Serum Lipids are Associated with Alzheimer Disease Pathophysiology,"INTRODUCTIONAltered regulation of lipid metabolism in Alzheimer disease (AD) can be characterized using lipidomic profiling.

METHOD349 serum lipids were measured in 806 participants enrolled in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Phase 1 (ADNI1) cohort and analysed using lipid regression models and lipid set enrichment statistics.

RESULTSAD diagnosis was associated with 7 of 28 lipid sets of which four also correlated with cognitive decline, including polyunsaturated fatty acids. CSF amyloid beta A{beta}1-42 correlated with glucosylceramides, lysophosphatidyl cholines and unsaturated triacylglycerides; CSF total tau and brain atrophy correlated with monounsaturated sphingomyelins and ceramides, in addition to EPA-containing lipids.

DISCUSSIONLipid desaturation, elongation and acyl chain remodeling are dysregulated across the spectrum of AD pathogenesis. Monounsaturated lipids were important in early stages of AD, while polyunsaturated lipid metabolism was associated with later stages of AD.

SIGNFICANCEBoth metabolic genes and co-morbidity with metabolic diseases indicate that lipid metabolism is critical in the etiology of Alzheimers disease (AD). For 800 subjects, we found that sets of blood lipids were associated with current AD-biomarkers and with AD clinical symptoms. Our study highlights the role of disturbed acyl chain lipid remodelling in several lipid classes. Our work has significant implications on finding a cure for AD. Depending on subject age, human blood lipids may have different effects on AD development. Remodelling of acyl chains needs to be studied in relation to genetic variants and environmental factors. Specifically, the impact of dietary supplements and drugs on lipid remodelling must be investigated.","Barupal, D. K.; Bailli, R.; Fan, S.; Saykin, A. J.; Meikle, P.

85,63047,Pancreatic Stellate Cells Secrete Deoxycytidine Conferring Resistance to Gemcitabine in PDAC,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. The deoxynucleoside analog gemcitabine is among the most effective therapies to treat PDAC; however, nearly all patients treated with gemcitabine either fail to respond or rapidly develop resistance. One hallmark of PDAC is a striking accumulation of stromal tissue surrounding the tumor, and this accumulation of stroma can contribute to therapy resistance. To better understand how stroma limits response to therapy, we investigated cell-extrinsic mechanisms of resistance to gemcitabine. We show that conditioned media from pancreatic stellate cells (PSC), as well as from other fibroblasts, protects PDAC cells from gemcitabine toxicity. We find that the PSC conditioned media protective effect is mediated by secretion of deoxycytidine, but not other deoxynucleosides, through equilibrative nucleoside transporters. Deoxycytidine inhibits the processing of gemcitabine in PDAC cells, thus reducing the effect of gemcitabine and other nucleoside analogs on cancer cells. Our results suggest that reducing deoxycytidine production in PSCs may increase the efficacy of nucleoside analog therapies.

86,63293,Increased Neurite Orientation-Dispersion and Density in the TgCRND8 Mouse Model of Amyloidosis: Inverse Relation with Functional Connectome Clustering and Modulation by Interleukin-6,"Extracellular {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) plaque deposits and inflammatory immune activation are thought to alter various aspects of tissue microstructure, such as extracellular free water, fractional anisotropy and diffusivity, as well as the density and geometric arrangement of axonal processes. Quantifying these microstructural changes in Alzheimers disease and related neurodegenerative dementias could serve to accurately monitor or predict disease course. In the present study we used high-field diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to determine how A{beta} and inflammatory interleukin-6 (IL6), alone or in combination, affect in vivo tissue microstructure in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimers-type A{beta} deposition. TgCRND8 and non-transgenic (nTg) mice expressing brain-targeted IL6 or enhanced glial fibrillary protein (EGFP controls) were scanned at 8 months of age using a 2-shell, 54-gradient direction dMRI sequence at 11.1 Tesla. Images were processed using the free water elimination method and the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model. DTI and NODDI processing in TgCRND8 mice revealed a microstructure pattern consistent with reduced white matter integrity along with an increase in density and geometric complexity of axonal and dendritic processes. This included reduced FA, mean diffusivity (MD), and free water (FW), and increased  neurite density (NDI) and orientation dispersion (ODI). IL6 produced a  protective-like effect on FA in TgCRND8 mice, although there were minimal microstructure changes in these mice compared IL6 expressing nTg mice. In addition, we found that NDI and ODI had an inverse relationship with the functional connectome clustering coefficient, which was affected by A{beta} and IL6. The relationship between NODDI and graph theory metrics suggests that increasing the density and orientation dispersion of neurites may relate to diminished functional network organization in the brain.","Colon-Perez, L.

87,64549,Alzheimer disease and Apolipoprotein E4: meningeal brain lymphatics point to new clues in pathogenesis,"The role of the lymphatic system in brain function and/or dysfunction has long been an enigma. However, recent reports that meningeal lymphatic vessels exist within the mouse and human brain, as well as evidence that mouse meningeal lymphatic vessels play a role in clearing the toxic amyloid-beta peptide connected with Alzheimers disease (AD), may herald novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues. Here, we explore new evidence connecting the lymphatic system of the brain with AD. In particular, we focus on new findings showing that meningeal lymphatic vessels play a role in drainage of cerebrospinal fluid and egress of immune cells from the brain, and that disrupting this vessel system leads to accumulation of amyloid - beta peptide and cognitive dysfunction. We also discuss the hypothesis that apolipoprotein E isoform e4 (APO E4) [boxh] the leading genetic risk for developing AD [boxh] is involved in meningeal lymphatic vessel function. By reanalyzing previously published RNA-Seq data, we show that APO E4 knock-in microglia cells express lower levels of genes representing lymphatic markers (a phenomenon we call \""attenuated lymphaticness\"") and of genes in which functional missense mutations are linked to lymphedema. Accordingly, we propose the hypothesis that APO E4 is involved in the shrinkage of lymphatic vessels. This notion could lead, if verified by additional anatomic and mechanistic data, to the concept that APO E4-related AD (such as in late onset AD or trisomy 21-related AD) is related to lymphosclerosis coupled with lymphedema.","Chrousos, G.

88,64557,Transcriptional profiling reveals running promotes cerebrovascular remodeling in young but not aged mice,"BackgroundThe incidence of dementia and cognitive decline is increasing with no therapy or cure. One of the reasons treatment remains elusive is because there are various pathologies that contribute to age-related cognitive decline. Specifically, with Alzheimers disease, targeting to reduce amyloid beta plaques and phosphorylated tau aggregates in clinical trials has not yielded results to slow symptomology, suggesting a new approach is needed. Interestingly, exercise has been proposed as a potential therapeutic intervention to improve brain health and reduce the risk for dementia, however the benefits throughout aging are not well understood.\n\nResultsTo better understand the effects of exercise, we preformed transcriptional profiling on young (1-2 months) and midlife (12 months) C57BL/6J (B6) male mice after 12 weeks of voluntary running. Data was compared to age-matched sedentary controls. Interestingly, the midlife running group naturally broke into two cohorts based on distance ran - either running a lot and more intensely (high runners) or running less and less intensely (low runners). Midlife high runners had lower LDL cholesterol as well as lower adiposity (%fat) compared to sedentary, than midlife low runners compared to sedentary suggesting more intense running lowered systemic markers of risk for age-related diseases including dementias. Differential gene analysis of transcriptional profiles generated from the cortex and hippocampus showed thousands of differentially expressed (DE) genes when comparing young runners to sedentary controls. However, only a few hundred genes were DE comparing either midlife high runners or midlife low runners to midlife sedentary controls. This indicates that, in our study, the effects of running are reduced through aging. Gene set enrichment analyses identified enrichment of genes involved in extracellular matrix (ECM), vascular remodeling and angiogenesis in young runners but not midlife runners. These genes are known to be expressed in multiple vascular-related cell types including astrocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes and smooth muscle cells.\n\nConclusionsTaken together these results suggest running may best serve as a preventative measure to reduce risk for cerebrovascular decline. Ultimately, this work shows that exercise may be more effective to prevent dementia if introduced at younger ages.","Foley, K. E.; Yang, S.; Graham, L. C.; Howell, G.

We examined whether polygenic risk scores (PRS) were associated with cardiometabolic health indicators through childhood and adolescence.\n\nMETHODSIn 7,977 participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we tested whether a PRS for Alzheimers disease was associated with trajectories of cardiometabolic risk factors. We examined trajectories for height 1-18 years; lean and fat mass 9-18 years; systolic and diastolic blood pressure 7-18 years; glucose and C-reactive protein 9-18 years; insulin 10-18 years; high and low-density lipoproteins and triglycerides birth-18 years. We also examined birthweight, interleukin-6 (IL-6) at age 9 years and physical activity at ages 11, 12, and 15 years.\n\nRESULTSNo consistent associations were observed between the PRS excluding genetic variants in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene region and cardiometabolic factors trajectories across childhood and adolescence.\n\nCONCLUSIONWe did not detect evidence to suggest that the PRS for Alzheimers disease acts through childhood and adolescent cardiometabolic risk factors. Further studies should examine whether these associations emerge later in adulthood when variation in cardiometabolic risk factors is likely to be greater.","Korologou-Linden, R.; O'keeffe, L.; Howe, L.; Davey Smith, G.; Jones, H.; Anderson, E.

90,65247,A game theoretic approach to deciphering the dynamics of amyloid-ß aggregation along competing pathways,"Aggregation of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) peptides is a significant event that underpins Alzheimer disease (AD). A{beta} aggregates, especially the low-molecular weight oligomers, are the primary toxic agents in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, there is increasing interest in understanding their formation and behavior. In this paper, we use our previously established investigations on heterotypic interactions between A{beta} and fatty acids (FAs) that adopt off-fibril formation pathway under the control of FA concentrations, to develop a mathematical framework in defining this complex mechanism. We bring forth the use of novel game theoretic framework based on the principles of Nash equilibria to define and simulate the competing on- and off-pathways of A{beta} aggregation. Together with detailed simulations and biophysical experiments, our mathematical models define the dynamics involved in the mechanisms of A{beta} aggregation in the presence of FAs to adopt multiple pathways. Specifically, our game theoretic model indicates that the emergence of off- or on-pathway aggregates are tightly controlled by a narrow set of rate constant parameters, and one could alter such parameters to populate a particular oligomeric species. These models agree with the detailed simulations and experimental data on using FA as a heterotypic partner to modulate temporal parameters. Predicting spatiotemporal landscape along competing pathways for a given heterotypic partner such as biological lipids is a first step towards simulating physiological scenarios in which the generation of specific conformeric strains of A{beta} could be predicted. Such an approach could be profoundly significant in deciphering the biophysics of amyloid aggregation and oligomer generation, which is ubiquitously observed in many neurodegenerative diseases.","Ghosh, P.; Rana, P.; Rangachari, V.; Saha, J.; Steen, E.; Vaidya, A.",18/03/2019,Biophysics,10.1101/581629,1,Ashwin Vaidya,Montclair State University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/581629v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/581629v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1098/rsos.191814,

Solute carrier function in AD has not been widely studied. This study tests the hypothesis that organic cation transporters contribute to the BBB delivery of antipsychotics and is disrupted in AD.\n\nIn vitro BBB studies indicated that [3H]amisulpride and [3H]haloperidol were transported by OCT1. Amisulpride also utilized PMAT. Molecular docking predicted that amisulpride and haloperidol are OCT1, PMAT and MATE1 substrates, and amisulpride is not a P-gp substrate. Amisulpride brain uptake increased in 3xTgAD compared to wildtype mice. PMAT and MATE1 expression was reduced in brain from AD patients compared to controls. The increased sensitivity of Alzheimers patients to amisulpride is related to previously unreported changes in OCT1, PMAT and MATE1 function/expression at the BBB. Dose adjustments may be required for drugs that are substrates of these transporters when prescribing for AD patients.","Sekhar, G. N.; Fleckney, A. L.; Boyanova, S.

92,65640,Beta secretase 1-dependent amyloid precursor protein processing promotes excessive vascular sprouting through NOTCH3 signaling,"Amyloid beta peptides (A{beta}) proteins play a key role in vascular pathology in Alzheimers Disease (AD) including impairment of the blood brain barrier and aberrant angiogenesis. Although previous work has demonstrated a pro-angiogenic role of A{beta}, the exact mechanisms by which amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and endothelial angiogenic signalling cascades interact in AD remain a largely unsolved problem. Here, we report that increased endothelial sprouting in human-APP transgenic mouse (TgCRND8) tissue is dependent on {beta}-secretase (BACE1) processing of APP. Higher levels of A{beta} processing in TgCRND8 tissue coincides with decreased NOTCH3/JAG1 signalling, over-production of endothelial filopodia and increased numbers of vascular pericytes. Using a novel in vitro approach to study sprouting angiogenesis in TgCRND8 organotypic brain slice cultures (OBSCs), we find that BACE1 inhibition normalises excessive endothelial filopodia formation and restores NOTCH3 signalling. These data present the first evidence for the potential of BACE1 inhibition as an effective therapeutic target for aberrant angiogenesis in AD.\n\nSignificanceIn this study, we show that targeting amyloid beta processing provides an opportunity to selectively target tip cell filopodia-driven angiogenesis and develop therapeutic targets for vascular dysfunction related to aberrant angiogenesis in AD. Our data provide the first evidence for a safe level of BACE1 inhibition that can normalize excess angiogenesis in AD, without inducing vascular deficits in healthy tissue. Our findings may pave the way for the development of new angiogenesis dependent therapeutic strategies in Alzheimers Disease.","Durrant, C. S.; Ruscher, K.; Sheppard, O.; Coleman, M.

Importantly, aggregation of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) proteins is considered as a major cause for the development of Alzheimers disease. The process depends on various conditions and typical test-tube experiments require high protein concentration that complicates the translation of results obtained in vitro to understanding the aggregation process in vivo. Here we demonstrate that A{beta}42 monomers at the membrane bilayer are capable of self-assembling into aggregates at physiologically low concentrations, and the membrane in this aggregation process plays a role of a catalyst. We applied all-atom molecular dynamics to demonstrate that the interaction with the membrane surface dramatically changes the conformation of A{beta}42 protein. As a result, the misfolded A{beta}42 rapidly assembles into dimers, trimers and tetramers, so the on-surface aggregation is the mechanism by which amyloid oligomers are produced and spread.","Banerjee, S.; Hashemi, M.; Zagorski, K.; Lyubchenko, Y.",23/03/2019,Neuroscience,10.1101/587493,1,Yuri Lyubchenko,University of Nebraska Medical Center,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/587493v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/587493v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.3390/ijms21031129,

Despite the central role for microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration little is known about their epigenetic regulation of the inflammatory response. Here, we show that Ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) methylcytosine dioxygenase expression is increased in microglia upon stimulation with various inflammogens through a NF-{kappa}B-dependent pathway. We found that TET2 regulates early gene transcriptional changes that lead to early metabolic alterations, as well as a later inflammatory response independently of its 5mC oxidation activity at the affected genes. We further show that TET2 regulates the proinflammatory response in microglia induced by intraperitoneal injection of LPS in vivo. We observed that microglia associated to amyloid {beta} plaques, recently defined as disease-associated microglia, expressed TET2 in brain tissue from individuals with Alzheimers disease (AD) and in 5xFAD mice.

For spatially-sensitive neurons, such as grid cells, to faithfully represent the environment these circuits require precise encoding of direction and velocity information. Here we have probed the firing rate coding properties of neurons in medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) in a mouse model of tauopathy. We find that grid cell firing patterns are largely absent in rTg4510 mice, while head direction tuning remains largely intact. Conversely, neural representation of running speed information was significantly disturbed, with smaller proportions of MEC cells having firing rates correlated with locomotion in rTg4510 mice. Additionally, the power of local field potential oscillations in the theta and gamma frequency bands, which in wildtype mice are tightly linked to running speed, was invariant in rTg4510 mice.

96,66811,Early Hippocampal Sharp-Wave Ripple Deficits Predict Later Learning and Memory Impairments in an Alzheimer’s Disease Mouse Model,"Alzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by progressive memory loss, and there is a pressing need to identify early pathophysiological alterations that predict subsequent memory impairment. Hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) - electrophysiological signatures of memory reactivation in the hippocampus - are a compelling candidate for doing so. Mouse models of AD show reductions in both SWR abundance and associated slow gamma (SG) power during aging, but these alterations have yet to be directly linked to memory impairments. In aged apolipoprotein E4 knock in (apoE4-KI) mice - a model of the major genetic risk factor for AD - we found that reduced SWR abundance and associated CA3 SG power predicted spatial memory impairments measured 1-2 months later. Importantly, SWR-associated CA3 SG power reduction in young apoE4-KI mice also predicted spatial memory deficits measured 10 months later. These results establish features of SWRs as potential functional biomarkers of memory impairment in AD.","Jones, E. A.; Gillespie, A. K.; Yoon, S. Y.; Frank, L.

97,67043,Cognitive Improvements after Intermittent Deep Brain Stimulation of the Nucleus Basalis of Meynert in a Transgenic Rat Model for Alzheimer’s disease; a Preliminary Approach,"BackgroundDeep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) has shown to have promising results in a pilot study with patients suffering from Alzheimers disease (AD). A recent study in aged monkeys shows a novel intermittent stimulation pattern to have superior cognitive benefits over continuous paradigms.\n\nObjective/HypothesisWe aimed at comparing the cognitive effects elicited by intermittent and continuous NBM stimulation paradigms in an animal model for AD (TgF344-AD rat line; TG), i.e. rats expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (APPsw) and presenilin 1 (PS1{Delta}E9) genes, each independent causes of early-onset familial AD.\n\nMethodsIn this exploratory study, aged APP/PS1 rats were tested pre-, and post implantation with several stimulation parameters, i.e. unilateral- or bilateral-intermittent, and bilateral-continuous, while performing various behavioral tasks (open field, novel object recognition, and modified Barnes maze).\n\nResults and ConclusionBilateral-intermittent NBM DBS allowed aged TG rats to perform better and maintain their performance longer in a spatial memory task, as compared to other conditions. These data support the notion that NBM DBS could be further refined in the clinic, thereby improving patient care.","Koulousakis, P.; Van Den Hove, D.; Visser-Vandewalle, V.; Sesia, T.",05/04/2019,Neuroscience,10.1101/600296,1,Philippos Koulousakis,University Hospital Clinic of Cologne,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/600296v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/600296v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,10.3233/JAD-190919,
98,68315,Sex-dependent polygenic effects on the clinical progressions of Alzheimer’s disease,"Sex differences in the manifestations of Alzheimers disease (AD) are under intense investigations 1,2. Despite the emerging importance of polygenic predictions for AD 3-8, the sex-dependent polygenic effects have not been demonstrated. Here, using a sex crossover analysis, we show that sex-dependent autosomal genetic effects on AD can be revealed by characterizing disease progress via the hazard function. We first performed sex-stratified genome-wide associations, and then applied derived sex-dependent weights to two independent cohorts. Sex-matched polygenic hazard scores (PHS) have significantly stronger associations with age-at-disease-onset, clinical progressions, amyloid depositions, neurofibrillary tangles, and composite neuropathological scores, than sex-mismatched PHS, independent of apolipoprotein E. Models without using hazard weights, i.e. polygenic risk scores (PRS), have lower predictive power than PHS and show no evidence for sex differences. Our results indicate revealing sex-dependent genetic architecture requires the consideration of temporal processes of AD. This has strong implications not only for the genetic underpinning of AD but also for how we estimate sex-dependent polygenic effects for clinical use.","Fan, C. C.; Banks, S. J.; Thompson, W.

99,70265,B-SIDER: Computational Algorithm for the Design of Complementary ß-sheet Sequences,"The {beta}-sheet is an element of protein secondary structure, and intra-/inter-molecular {beta}-sheet interactions play pivotal roles in biological regulatory processes including scaffolding, transporting, and oligomerization. In nature, a {beta}-sheet formation is tightly regulated because dysregulated {beta}-stacking often leads to severe diseases such as Alzheimers, Parkinsons, systemic amyloidosis, or diabetes. Thus, the identification of intrinsic {beta}-sheet forming propensities can provide valuable insight into protein designs for the development of novel therapeutics. However, structure-based design methods may not be generally applicable to such amyloidogenic peptides mainly owing to high structural plasticity and complexity. Therefore, an alternative design strategy based on complementary sequence information is of significant importance. Herein, we developed a database search method called B-SIDER for the design of complementary {beta}-strands. This method makes use of the structural database information and generates query-specific score matrices. The discriminatory power of the B-SIDER score function was tested on representative amyloidogenic peptide substructures against a sequence-based score matrix (PASTA2.0) and two popular ab initio protein design score functions (Rosetta and FoldX). B-SIDER is able to distinguish wild-type amyloidogenic {beta}-strands as favored interactions in a more consistent manner than other methods. B-SIDER was prospectively applied to the design of complementary {beta}-strands for a splitGFP scaffold. Three variants were identified to have stronger interactions than the original sequence selected through a directed evolution, emitting higher fluorescence intensities. Our results indicate that B-SIDER can be applicable to the design of other {beta}-strands, assisting in the development of therapeutics against disease-related amyloidogenic peptides.","Yu, T.-G.; Kim, H.-S.; Choi, Y.",04/08/2019,Bioinformatics,10.1101/631069,2,Hak-Sung Kim,Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/631069v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/631069v2.full.pdf,cc_by,10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00548,

We recently discovered that the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic AD, apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE4), exacerbates synapse loss and synaptic accumulation of oligomeric amyloid beta in human AD brain. To begin to understand the molecular cascades involved in synapse loss in AD and how this is mediated by APOE, and to generate a resource of knowledge of changes in the synaptic proteome in AD, we conducted a proteomic screen and systematic in-silico analysis of synaptoneurosome preparations from temporal and occipital cortices of human AD and control subjects with known APOE gene status. Our analysis identified over 5,500 proteins in human synaptoneurosomes and highlighted disease, brain region, and APOE-associated changes in multiple molecular pathways including a decreased abundance in AD of proteins important for synaptic and mitochondrial function and an increased abundance of proteins involved in neuroimmune interactions and intracellular signaling.\n\nHighlightsO_LIProteomic analysis of synapses isolated from Alzheimers disease and control subject brains identifies over 5,500 proteins in human synapses.\nC_LIO_LIIn silico analysis reveals region-specific decreases in proteins involved in synaptic and mitochondrial function and increases in proteins involved in neuroimmune signaling and intracellular signaling in AD.\nC_LIO_LIThe apolipoprotein E4 risk gene is associated with exacerbated changes in synaptic proteins in AD.\nC_LI","Hesse, R.; Llavero Hurtado, M.; Jackson, R.; Eaton, S.

101,70505,A new clinical tool to predict outcome in early-stage melanoma patients,"Around 25% of early-stage melanoma patients eventually develop metastasis. Thus, we set out to define serological biomarkers that could be used along with clinical and histopathological features of the disease to predict these events. We previously demonstrated that in stage II melanoma patients, serum levels of dermcidin (DCD) were associated with metastatic progression. Based on the relevance of the immune response on the cancer progression and the recent association of DCD with local and systemic immune response against cancer cells, serum DCD was analyzed in a new cohort of patients along with IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN{gamma} TGF{beta} and GM-CSF. We included 448 melanoma patients, 323 of whom were diagnosed as stages I-II according to AJCC. Levels of selected cytokines were determined by ELISA and Luminex and obtained data were analyzed employing Machine Learning and Kaplan-Meier techniques to define an algorithm capable of accurately classifying early-stage melanoma patients with a high and low risk of developing metastasis. The results show that in early-stage melanoma patients, serum levels of the cytokines IL-4, GM-CSF and DCD together with the Breslow thickness are those that best predict melanoma metastasis. Moreover, resulting algorithm represents a new tool to discriminate subjects with good prognosis from those with high risk for a future metastasis.

Novelty and ImpactWe have developed a prognostic equation that considers the serum IL-4, GM-CSF and DCD levels, along with the Breslow thickness to accurately classify melanoma outcome in patients. In this sense, a rigorous follow-up is recommended for early-stage melanoma patients with a high Breslow thickness, high serum IL-4 levels and low GM-CSF and DCD levels at the time of diagnosis, given the elevated risk for these patients to develop metastasis during follow-up.","Mancuso, F.; Lage, S.; Rasero, J.; Diaz-Ramon, J.

We tested its involvement in a variety of inflammatory responses using human AGP-1 purified to apparent homogeneity and confirmed its identity by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. AGP-1 alone upregulated MAPK signaling in murine peritoneal macrophages. However, when given in combination with TLR ligands, AGP-1 selectively augmented MAPK activation induced by ligands of TLR-2 (Braun lipoprotein) but not TLR-4 (lipopolysaccharide). In vivo treatment of AGP-1 in a murine model of sepsis with or without TLR-2 or TLR-4 ligands, selectively potentiated TLR-2-mediated mortality, but was without significant effect on TLR-4-mediated mortality. Furthermore, in vitro, AGP-1 selectively potentiated TLR-2 mediated adhesion of human primary immune cell, neutrophils. Hence, our studies highlight a new role for the acute phase protein AGP-1 in sepsis via its interaction with TLR-2 signaling mechanisms to selectively promote responsiveness to one of the two major gram-negative endotoxins, contributing to the complicated pathobiology of sepsis.","Mosale, S.

103,70559,Increasing objective cardiometabolic burden associated with attenuations in the P3b event-related potential component in older adults,"Cardiometabolic diseases and risk factors increase the risk of late-life cognitive impairment and dementia, and have also been associated with detrimental grey and white matter changes. However the functional brain changes associated with cardiometabolic health in late-life are unclear. We sought to characterise these functional changes by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) during a n-back working memory task (0, 1 and 2 back) in 85 adults (60% female) between 50 and 80 years of age. Due to a stratified recruitment approach, participants varied widely regarding cognitive function and cardiometabolic health. Standard and objective cut-offs for high blood glucose, waist to hip ratio (i.e. obesity), high blood cholesterol, and hypertension were employed to generate a summative score for cardiometabolic burden (none, one, or two or more above cut-off). Mixed effects modelling (covarying for age and gender) revealed no statistically significant associations between cardiometabolic burden and visual P1 and N1 component amplitudes. There was a significant effect for the P3b component: as cardiometabolic burden increased, P3b amplitude decreased. We show that cardiometabolic factors related to the development of cognitive impairment and dementia in late-life associate with functional brain activity, as recorded via ERPs. Findings have relevance for the monitoring of lifestyle interventions (typically targeting cardiometabolic factors) in ageing, as ERPs may provide a more sensitive measure of change than cognitive performance. Further, our results raise questions related to the findings of a broad range of ERP studies where the groups compared may differ in their cardiometabolic health status (not only in psychological symptomatology).","Keage, H.; Feurriegel, D.; Greaves, D.; Tregoweth, E.; Coussens, S.; Smith, A.",12/05/2019,Neuroscience,10.1101/634873,1,Hannah Keage,University of South Australia,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/634873v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/634873v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.3389/fneur.2020.00643,
104,71533,Inhibition of de novo ceramide biosynthesis affects aging phenotype in an in vitro model of neuronal senescence,"Although aging is considered to be an unavoidable event, recent experimental evidence suggests that the process can be delayed, counteracted, if not completely interrupted. Aging is the primary risk factor for the onset and development of neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Intracellular calcium (Ca2+i) dyshomeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and lipid dysregulation are critical factors that contribute to senescence-related processes. Ceramides, a class of sphingolipids involved in a wide array of biological functions, are important mediators of cellular senescence, but their role in neuronal aging is still largely unexplored.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the effects of L-cycloserine (L-CS), an inhibitor of de novo ceramide biosynthesis, on the aging phenotype of cortical neurons that have been maintained in culture for 22 days, a setting employed as an in vitro model of cellular senescence. Our findings indicate that  aged neurons display, when compared to control cultures, overt dysregulation of cytosolic and subcellular [Ca2+]i levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, increased reactive oxygen species generation, altered synaptic activity as well as the activation of neuronal death-related molecules. Treatment with L-CS (30 {micro}M) positively affected the senescent phenotype, a result accompanied by recovery of neuronal [Ca2+]i signaling, and reduction of mitochondrial dysfunction and reactive oxygen species generation.\n\nThe results suggest that the de novo ceramide biosynthesis may represent a critical intermediate in the molecular and functional cascade leading to neuronal senescence. Our findings also identify ceramide biosynthesis inhibitors as promising pharmacological tools to decrease age-related neuronal dysfunctions.","Granzotto, A.; Bomba, M.; Castelli, V.; Navarra, R.; Massetti, N.; Onofrj, M.; Cicalini, I.; Del Boccio, P.; Cimini, A.; Piomelli, D.; Sensi, S.

105,71652,Expression quantitative trait loci-derived scores and white matter microstructure in UK Biobank: a novel approach to integrating genetics and neuroimaging,"BackgroundExpression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) are genetic variants associated with gene expression. Using genome-wide genotype data, it is now possible to impute gene expression using eQTL mapping efforts. This approach can be used to analyse previously unexplored relationships between gene expression and heritable in vivo measures of human brain structural connectivity.\n\nMethodsUsing large-scale eQTL mapping studies, we computed 6,457 gene expression scores (eQTL scores) using genome-wide genotype data in UK Biobank, where each score represents a genetic proxy measure of gene expression. These scores were then tested for associations with two diffusion tensor imaging measures, fractional anisotropy (NFA=14,518) and mean diffusivity (NMD=14,485), representing white matter structural integrity.\n\nResultsWe found FDR-corrected significant associations between 8 eQTL scores and structural connectivity phenotypes, including global and regional measures ({beta}absolute FA=0.0339-0.0453; MD=0.0308-0.0381) and individual tracts ({beta}absolute FA=0.0320-0.0561; MD=0.0295-0.0480). The loci within these eQTL scores have been reported to regulate expression of genes involved in various brain-related processes and disorders, such as neurite outgrowth and Parkinsons disease (DCAKD, SLC35A4, SEC14L4, SRA1, NMT1, CPNE1, PLEKHM1, UBE3C).\n\nDiscussionOur findings indicate that eQTL scores are associated with measures of in vivo brain connectivity and provide novel information not previously found by conventional genome-wide association studies. Although the role of expression of these genes regarding white matter microstructural integrity is not yet clear, these findings suggest it may be possible, in future, to map potential trait- and disease-associated eQTL to in vivo brain connectivity and better understand the mechanisms of psychiatric disorders and brain traits, and their associated imaging findings.","Barbu, M.

106,74553,Predicting dysfunctional age-related task activations from resting-state network alterations,"Alzheimers disease (AD) is linked to changes in fMRI task activations and fMRI resting-state functional connectivity (restFC), which can emerge early in the timecourse of illness. Study of these fMRI correlates of unhealthy aging has been conducted in largely separate subfields. Taking inspiration from neural network simulations, we propose a unifying mechanism wherein restFC network alterations associated with Alzheimers disease disrupt the ability for activations to flow between brain regions, leading to aberrant task activations. We apply this activity flow modeling framework in a large sample of clinically unimpaired older adults, which was segregated into healthy (low-risk) and at-risk subgroups based on established imaging (positron emission tomography amyloid) and genetic (apolipoprotein) risk factors for AD. We identified healthy task activations in individuals at low risk for AD, and then by estimating activity flow using at-risk AD restFC data we were able to predict the altered at-risk AD task activations. Thus, modeling the flow of healthy activations over at-risk AD connectivity effectively transformed the healthy aged activations into unhealthy aged activations. These results provide evidence that activity flow over altered intrinsic functional connections may act as a mechanism underlying Alzheimers-related dysfunction, even in very early stages of the illness. Beyond these mechanistic insights linking restFC with cognitive task activations, this approach has potential clinical utility as it enables prediction of task activations and associated cognitive dysfunction in individuals without requiring them to perform in-scanner cognitive tasks.\n\nSignificance StatementDeveloping analytic approaches that can reliably predict features of Alzheimers disease is a major goal for cognitive and clinical neuroscience, with particular emphasis on identifying such diagnostic features early in the timeline of disease. We demonstrate the utility of an activity flow modeling approach, which predicts fMRI cognitive task activations in subjects identified as at-risk for Alzheimers disease. The approach makes activation predictions by transforming a healthy aged activation template via the at-risk subjects individual pattern of fMRI resting-state functional connectivity (restFC). The observed prediction accuracy supports activity flow as a mechanism linking age-related alterations in restFC and task activations, thereby providing a theoretical basis for incorporating restFC into imaging biomarker and personalized medicine interventions.","Mill, R.

107,74377,The effect of sample size on polygenic hazard models for prostate cancer,"We aimed to determine the effect of sample size on performance of polygenic hazard score (PHS) models in predicting the age at onset of prostate cancer. Age and genotypes were obtained for 40,861 men from the PRACTICAL consortium. The dataset included 201,590 SNPs per subject, and was split into training (34,444 samples) and testing (6,417 samples) sets. Two PHS model-building strategies were investigated. Established-SNP model considered 65 SNPs that had been associated with prostate cancer in the literature. A stepwise SNP selection was used to develop Discovery-SNP models. The performance of each PHS model was calculated for random sizes of the training set (1 to 30 thousand). The performance of a representative Established-SNP model was estimated for random sizes of the testing set (0.5 to 6 thousand). Mean HR98/50 (hazard ratio of top 2% to the average in the test set) of the Established-SNP model increased from 1.73[95%CI: 1.69-1.77] to 2.41[2.40-2.43] when the number of training samples was increased from 1 to 30 thousand. The corresponding HR98/50 of the Discovery-SNP model increased from 1.05[0.93-1.18] to 2.19[2.16-2.23]. HR98/50 of a representative Established-SNP model using testing set sample sizes of 0.6 and 6 thousand observations were 1.78[1.70-1.85] and 1.73[1.71-1.76], respectively. We estimate that a study population of 20 to 30 thousand men is required to develop Discovery-SNP PHS models for prostate cancer. The required sample size could be reduced to 10 thousand samples, if a set of SNPs associated with the disease has already been established.\n\nAuthor summaryPolygenic hazard scores represent a recent advancement in polygenic prediction to model the age of onset of various diseases, such as Alzheimers disease or prostate cancer. These scores accumulate small effect sizes from several tens of genetic variants and can be used to establish an individuals risk of experiencing an event relative to a control population across time. The largest barrier to the development of polygenic hazard scores is the large number of study subjects needed to develop the underlying models. We sought to understand the effect of varying the total number of samples on the performance of a polygenic hazard score in the context of prostate cancer. We found that the performance of the score did not appreciably change beyond 20 to 30 thousand observations when developing the model from scratch. However, when the discovery of the genetic variants can be borrowed from those already identified in the literature to be associated with the disease, the required number of samples is reduced to 10 thousand with no appreciable detriment in performance. We hope that these results can guide the design of future studies of polygenic scores in other diseases and demonstrate the importance of genome-wide association studies.","Karunamuni, R.; Huynh-Le, M.-P.; Fan, C.; Eeles, R.; Easton, D.; Kote-Jarai, Z.; Al Olama, A.

108,74513,HTT is a repressor of ABL activity required for APP induced axonal growth,"ABL tyrosine kinase activity controls several aspects of development including axon patterning. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is linked to Alzheimers disease and previous work established that ABL is a downstream effector in an Appl, the Drosophila App ortholog, signaling pathway which modulates axon outgrowth in the mushroom bodies (MBs), the fly memory center. Here we show that Abl is required for the MB neuron axonal growth. Importantly, both Abl overexpression and lack of expression produce a similar phenotype in the MBs indicating the necessity of tightly regulating ABL activity. We find that the fly huntingtin protein (HTT), the homolog of the protein involved in Huntingtons disease, behaves genetically as a repressor of ABL activity. Supporting this, FRET-based measurements of in vivo ABL activity in the MBs reveal a clear increase in its activity when HTT levels are reduced. Thus, in addition to its many other reported roles, HTT acts as a negative regulator of ABL activity, at least in the MBs, to maintain its appropriate physiological levels necessary for axon growth.","Marquilly, C.; Busto, G.; Leger, B.

Changes in telomere length have been associated with aging and some degenerative diseases. Our aim was to explore some of the molecular changes caused by the progression of AD in a transgenic murine model (3xTg-AD; B6; 129-Psen1 <tm1Mpm> Tg (APPSwe, tauP301L) 1Lfa). Telomere length was assessed by qPCR in both brain tissue and peripheral blood cells and compared between three age groups: 5, 9, and 13 months. In addition, a possible effect of oxidative stress on telomere length and AD progression was explored. Shorter telomeres were found in blood cells of older transgenic mice compared to younger and wild type mice but no changes in telomere length in the hippocampus. An increase in oxidative stress with age was found for all strains but no correlation was found between oxidative stress and shorter telomere length for transgenic mice. Telomere length and oxidative stress are affected by AD progression in the 3xTg-AD murine model. Changes in blood cells are more noticeable than changes in brain tissue, suggesting that systemic changes can be detected early in the disease in this murine model.","Martinez-Gonzalez, K.

Improved spatial and recognition memory in Old Tg-FY and enhanced recognition memory in Old Tg-FO were observed when compared to Old Tg-Control mice given saline.

111,75441,Causal associations between potentially modifiable risk factors and the Alzheimer’s phenome: A Mendelian randomization study,"ObjectiveTo evaluate the causal association of 22 previously reported risk factors for Alzheimers disease (AD) on the ""AD phenome"": AD, AD age of onset (AAOS), hippocampal volume, cortical surface area and thickness, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of A{beta}42, tau, and ptau181, and the neuropathological burden of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and vascular brain injury (VBI).

MethodsPolygenic risk scores (PRS) for the 22 risk factors were computed in 26,431 AD cases/controls and the association with AD was evaluated using logistic regression. Two-sample Mendelian randomization was used to evaluate the causal effect of risk factors on the AD phenome.

ResultsPRS for increased education and diastolic blood pressure were associated with reduced risk for AD. PRS for increased total cholesterol and moderate-vigorous physical activity were associated with an increased risk of AD. MR indicated that only Education was causally associated with reduced risk of AD, delayed AAOS, and increased cortical surface area and thickness. Total-and LDL-cholesterol levels were causally associated with increased neuritic plaque burden, while diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure are causally associated with increased risk of VBI. Furthermore, total cholesterol was associated with decreased hippocampal volume; smoking initiation and BMI with decreased cortical thickness; and sleep duration with increased cortical thickness.

InterpretationOur comprehensive examination of the genetic evidence for the causal roles of previously reported risk factors in AD using PRS and MR, supports a causal role for education, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking, and BMI with the AD phenome.","Andrews, S.

112,75486,Brain connectivity during Alzheimer’s disease progression and its cognitive impact in a transgenic rat model,"The research of Alzheimers disease (AD) in their early stages and its progression till symptomatic onset is essential to understand the pathology and investigate new treatments. Animal models provide a helpful approach to this research, since they allow for controlled follow-up during the disease evolution. In this work, transgenic TgF344-AD rats were longitudinally evaluated starting at 6 months of age. Every 3 months, cognitive abilities were assessed by a memory-related task and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired. Structural and functional brain networks were estimated and characterized by graph metrics to identify differences between the groups in connectivity, its evolution with age, and its influence on cognition. Structural networks of transgenic animals were altered since the earliest stage. Likewise, aging significantly affected network metrics in TgF344-AD, but not in the control group. In addition, while the structural brain network influenced cognitive outcome in transgenic animals, functional network impacted how control subjects performed. TgF344-AD brain network alterations were present from very early stages, difficult to identify in clinical research. Likewise, the characterization of aging in these animals, involving structural network reorganization and its effects on cognition, opens a window to evaluate new treatments for the disease.

AUTHOR SUMMARYWe have applied magnetic resonance image based connectomics to characterize TgF344-AD rats, a transgenic model of Alzheimers disease (AD). This represents a highly translational approach, what is essential to investigate potential treatments. TgF344-AD animals were evaluated from early to advanced ages to describe alterations in brain connectivity and how brain networks are affected by age. Results showed that aging had a bigger impact in the structural connectivity of the TgF344-AD than in control animals, and that changes in the structural network, already observed at early ages, significantly influenced cognitive outcome of transgenic animals. Alterations in connectivity were similar to the described in AD human studies, and complement them providing insights into earlier stages and a plot of AD effects throughout the whole life span.","Munoz-Moreno, E.; Tudela, R.; Lopez-Gil, X.; Soria, G.",02/07/2019,Neuroscience,10.1101/690180,1,Emma Muñoz-Moreno,Institud d'Investigacions Biomèdiques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS),https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/690180v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/690180v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1162/netn_a_00126,

Here we use a data-driven systems biology approach across multiple cohorts of human AD, encompassing different brain regions, and integrate with multi-scale datasets comprising of DNA methylation, histone acetylation, transcriptome- and genome-wide association studies as well as quantitative trait loci to define the genetic architecture of AD. We perform co-expression network analysis across more than twelve hundred human brain samples, identifying robust AD-associated dysregulation of the transcriptome, unaltered in normal human aging. We further integrate co-expression modules with single-cell transcriptome generated from 27,321 nuclei from postmortem human brain to identify AD-specific transcriptional changes and assess cell-type proportion changes in the human AD brain. We also show that genetic variants of AD are enriched in a glial AD-associated module and identify key transcription factors regulating co-expressed modules. Additionally, we validate our results in multiple published human AD datasets which are easily accessible using our online resource (https://swaruplab.bio.uci.edu/consensusAD).","Morabito, S.; Miyoshi, E.; Michael, N.; Swarup, V.",07/07/2019,Neuroscience,10.1101/695221,1,Vivek Swarup,"Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA, USA",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/695221v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/695221v1.full.pdf,cc_no,10.1093/hmg/ddaa182,
114,76209,Modelling vegetation understory cover using LiDAR metrics,"Forest understory vegetation is an important feature of wildlife habitat among other things. Predicting and mapping understory is a critical need for forest management and conservation planning, but it has proved difficult. LiDAR has the potential to generate remotely sensed forest understory structure data, yet this potential has to be fully validated. Our objective was to examine the capacity of LiDAR point cloud data to predict forest understory cover. We modeled ground-based observations of understory structure in three vertical strata (0.5 m to < 1.5 m, 1.5 m to < 2.5 m, 2.5 m to < 3.5 m) as a function of a variety of LiDAR metrics using both mixed-effects and Random Forest models. We compared four understory LiDAR metrics designed to control for the spatial heterogeneity of sampling density. The four metrics were highly correlated and they all produced high values of variance explained in mixed-effects models. The top-ranked model used a voxel-based understory metric along with vertical stratum (Akaike weight = 1, explained variance = 87%, SMAPE=15.6%). We found evidence of occlusion of LiDAR pulses in the lowest stratum but no evidence that the occlusion influenced the predictability of understory structure. The Random Forest model results were consistent with those of the mixed-effects models, in that all four understory LiDAR metrics were identified as important, along with vertical stratum. The Random Forest model explained 74.4% of the variance, but had a lower cross-validation error of 12.9%. Based on these results, we conclude that the best approach to predict understory structure is using the mixed-effects model with the voxel-based understory LiDAR metric along with vertical stratum, but that other understory LiDAR metrics (fractional cover, normalized cover and leaf area density) would still be effective in mixed-effects and Random Forest modelling approaches.","Venier, L.

115,76472,Astrocyte senescence in an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model is mediated by TGF-ß1 and results in neurotoxicity,"Alterations in astrocyte function such as a pro-inflammatory phenotype are associated with Alzheimers disease (AD). We had shown impairments in the ability of aged astrocytes isolated from 5xFAD mice to clear and uptake amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) as well as to support neuronal growth. Senescent cells accumulate with age and exhibit a senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which includes secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we predicted that with age, astrocytes in 5xFAD mice would exhibit a cellular senescence phenotype that could promote neurodegeneration. We found an age-dependent increase in senescent astrocytes adjacent to A{beta} plaques in 5xFAD mice. Inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells reduced interelukin-6 secretion by senescent astrocytes and resulted in improved neuronal support. Moreover, senescent astrocytes exhibited an increase in the induction of the TGF-{beta}1-SMAD2/3 pathway, and inhibition of this pathway resulted in a reduction of cellular senescence. We also discovered that soluble A{beta}42 induced astrocyte senescence in young naive mice in a SMAD2/3-dependent manner. Our results suggest an important role of astrocyte senescence in AD and its role in mediating the neurotoxicity properties of astrocytes in AD and related neurodegenerative diseases.","Amram, S.; Iram, T.; Lazdon, E.; Vassar, R.; Ben Porath, I.; Frenkel, D.",12/07/2019,Neuroscience,10.1101/700013,1,Dan Frenkel,Tel Aviv University,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/700013v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/700013v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA,
116,76993,Forcing contacts between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum extends lifespan in a Drosophila model of Alzheimers disease,"Eukaryotic cells are complex systems containing internal compartments with specialised functions. Among these compartments, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a major role in processing proteins for modification and delivery to other organelles, whereas mitochondria generate energy in the form of ATP. Mitochondria and the ER form physical interactions, defined as mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCS) to exchange metabolites such as calcium ions (Ca2+) and lipids. Sites of contact between mitochondria and the ER can regulate biological processes such as ATP generation and mitochondrial division. The interactions between mitochondria and the ER are dynamic and respond to the metabolic state of cells. Changes in MERCS have been linked to metabolic pathologies such as diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases and sleep disruption.\n\nHere we explored the consequences of increasing contacts between mitochondria and the ER in flies using a synthetic linker. We showed that enhancing MERCS increases locomotion and extends lifespan. We also showed that, in a Drosophila model of Alzheimers disease linked to toxic amyloid beta (A{beta}), linker expression can suppress motor impairment and extend lifespan. We conclude that strategies for increasing contacts between mitochondria and the ER may ameliorate symptoms of diseases associated with mitochondria dysfunction.","Garrido-Maraver, J.; Loh, S. H.

Here we investigated the effects of APOE {varepsilon}4 on several brain cell types derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells and human APOE targeted replacement mice. Gene set enrichment and pathway analyses of whole transcriptome profiles showed that APOE {varepsilon}4 is associated with dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis in human but not mouse astrocytes and microglia. Elevated matrisome signaling associated with chemotaxis, glial activation and lipid biosynthesis in APOE {varepsilon}4 mixed neuron/astrocyte cultures parallels altered pathways uncovered in cell-type deconvoluted transcriptomic data from APOE {varepsilon}4 glia and AD post-mortem brains. Experimental validation of the transcriptomic findings showed that isogenic APOE {varepsilon}4 is associated with increased lysosomal cholesterol levels and decreased cholesterol efflux, demonstrating decoupled lipid metabolism. APOE {varepsilon}4 glia also secrete higher levels of proinflammatory chemokines, cytokines and growth factors, indicative of glial activation. Thus, APOE {varepsilon}4 induces human glia-specific dysregulation that may initiate AD risk.","Tcw, J.; Liang, S. A.; Qian, L.; Pipalia, N. H.; Chao, M. J.; Shi, Y.; Bertelsen, S.

119,78512,Apolipoprotein A-I Mimetic 4F Peptide Generates Amyloid Cytotoxins by Forming Hetero-oligomers with ß-amyloid,"Apolipoproteins are involved in pathological conditions of Alzheimers disease (AD), truncated apolipoprotein fragments and {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) peptides coexist as neurotoxic heteromers within the plaques. Therefore, it is important to investigate these complexes at the molecular level to better understand their properties and roles in the pathology of AD. Here, we present a mechanistic insight into such heteromerization using a structurally homologue apolipoprotein fragment of apoA-I (4F) complexed with A{beta}(M1-42) and characterize their toxicity. The 4F peptide slows down the aggregation kinetics of A{beta}(M1-42) by constraining its structural plasticity. NMR and CD experiments identified 4F-A{beta}(M1-42) heteromers as being comprised of unstructured A{beta}(M1-42) and helical 4F. A uniform {approx}2-fold reduction in A{beta}42 15N/1H NMR signal intensities with no observable chemical shift perturbation indicated the formation of a large complex, which was further confirmed by diffusion NMR experiments. Microsecond scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations showed that 4F interaction with A{beta}(M1-42) is electrostatically driven and induces unfolding of A{beta}(M1-42). Neurotoxicity profiling of A{beta}(M1-42) complexed with 4F confirms a significant reduction in cell-viability and neurite growth. The molecular architecture of heteromerization between 4F and A{beta}(M1-42) discovered in this study provides evidence towards our understanding of the role of apolipoproteins or their truncated fragments in exacerbating AD pathology.","Sahoo, B.; Bekier, M.; Liu, Z.; Kocman, V.; Stoddard, A.; Anantharamaiah, G.; Nowick, J.; Fierke, C.; Wang, Y.; Ramamoorthy, A.",04/08/2019,Biophysics,10.1101/722983,1,Ayyalusamy Ramamoorthy,University of Michigan,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/722983v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/722983v1.full.pdf,cc_by_nc_nd,NA,

Whereas the Cao et al.s cryo-EM structures contain both the hydrophobic and Q/N-rich segments, the data were interpreted mainly through the lens of hydrophobic contacts.

121,78487,Increased soluble amyloid-beta causes early aberrant brain network hypersynchronisation in a mature-onset mouse model of amyloidosis,"BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly population. Currently, no effective cure is available for AD. According to the amyloid hypothesis, the accumulation and deposition of the amyloid-beta (A{beta}) peptides plays a key role in AD pathology. Soluble A{beta} (sA{beta}) oligomers were shown to be synaptotoxic and involved in pathological hypersynchronisation of brain resting-state networks in different transgenic developmental-onset mouse models of amyloidosis. However, the impact of protein overexpression during brain postnatal development may cause additional phenotypes unrelated to AD. To address this concern, we investigated sA{beta} effects on functional resting-state networks in transgenic mature-onset amyloidosis Tet-Off APP (TG) mice.\n\nMethodsTG mice and control littermates were raised on doxycycline (DOX) diet from 3d up to 3m of age to suppress transgenic A{beta} production. Thereafter, longitudinal resting-state functional MRI was performed on a 9.4T MR-system starting from week 0 (3m old mice) up to 28w post DOX treatment. Ex vivo immunohistochemistry and ELISA analysis (additional mice cohort) was performed to address the development of amyloid pathology.\n\nResultsFunctional Connectivity (FC) analysis demonstrated early abnormal hypersynchronisation in the TG mice compared to the controls at 8w post DOX treatment. This effect was observed particularly across regions of the default mode-like network, known to be affected in AD. Ex vivo analyses performed at this time point confirmed a 20-fold increase in total sA{beta} levels and the absence of A{beta} plaques in the TG mice compared to the controls. On the contrary at week 28, TG mice showed an overall hypoconnectivity, coinciding with a widespread deposition of A{beta} plaques in the brain.\n\nConclusionsBy preventing developmental influence of APP and/or sA{beta} during brain postnatal development, we demonstrated FC abnormalities driven by sA{beta} synaptotoxicity on resting state neuronal networks in mature-induced TG mice. Thus, the Tet-Off APP mouse model could be a powerful tool while used as a mature-onset model to shed light into amyloidosis mechanisms in AD. Therefore, this inducible APP expression model used in combination with early non-invasive in vivo rsfMRI readout for sA{beta} synaptotoxicity sets the stage for future A{beta} targeting preventative treatment studies.","Ben-Nejma, I.

122,78760,Alcohol Drinking Exacerbates Neural and Behavioral Pathology in the 3xTg-AD Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease,"Alzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that represents the most common cause of dementia in the United States. Although the link between alcohol use and AD has been studied, preclinical research has potential to elucidate neurobiological mechanisms that underlie this interaction. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that non-dependent alcohol drinking exacerbates the onset and magnitude of AD-like neural and behavioral pathology. We first evaluated the impact of voluntary 24-h, 2-bottle choice home-cage alcohol drinking on the prefrontal cortex and amygdala neuroproteome in C57BL/6J mice and found a striking association between alcohol drinking and AD-like pathology. Bioinformatics identified the AD-associated proteins MAPT (Tau), amyloid beta precursor protein (APP), and presenilin-1 (PSEN-1) as the main modulators of alcohol-sensitive protein networks that included AD-related proteins that regulate energy metabolism (ATP5D, HK1, AK1, PGAM1, CKB), cytoskeletal development (BASP1, CAP1, DPYSL2 [CRMP2], ALDOA, TUBA1A, CFL2, ACTG1), cellular/oxidative stress (HSPA5, HSPA8, ENO1, ENO2), and DNA regulation (PURA, YWHAZ). To address the impact of alcohol drinking on AD, studies were conducted using 3xTg-AD mice that express human MAPT, APP, and PSEN-1 transgenes and develop AD-like brain and behavioral pathology. 3xTg-AD and wildtype mice consumed alcohol or saccharin for 4 months. Behavioral tests were administered during a 1-month alcohol free period. Alcohol intake induced AD-like behavioral pathologies in 3xTg-AD mice including impaired spatial memory in the Morris Water Maze, diminished sensorimotor gating as measured by prepulse inhibition, and exacerbated conditioned fear. Multiplex immunoassay conducted on brain lysates showed that alcohol drinking upregulated primary markers of AD pathology in 3xTg-AD mice: A{beta} 42/40 ratio in the lateral entorhinal and prefrontal cortex and total Tau expression in the lateral entorhinal cortex and amygdala at 1-month post alcohol exposure. Immunocytochemistry showed that alcohol use upregulated expression of pTau (Ser199/Ser202) in the hippocampus, which is consistent with late stage AD. According to the NIA-AA Research Framework, these results suggest that alcohol use is associated with Alzheimers pathology. Results also showed that alcohol use was associated with a general reduction in Akt/mTOR signaling via several phosphoproteins (IR, IRS1, IGF1R, PTEN, ERK, mTOR, p70S6K, RPS6) in multiple brain regions including hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Dysregulation of Akt/mTOR phosphoproteins suggests alcohol may target this pathway in AD progression. These results suggest that nondependent alcohol drinking increases the onset and magnitude of AD-like neural and behavioral pathology in 3xTg-AD mice.","Hoffman, J.

DM1 is caused by the expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3-untranslated region of DMPK. Longer CTG expansions are associated with greater symptom severity and earlier age at onset. The primary mechanism of pathogenesis is thought to be mediated by a gain of function of the CUG-containing RNA, that leads to trans-dysregulation of RNA metabolism of many other genes. Specifically, the alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) of many genes is known to be disrupted. In the context of clinical trials of emerging DM1 treatments, it is important to be able to objectively quantify treatment efficacy at the level of molecular biomarkers. We show how previously described candidate mRNA biomarkers can be used to model an effective reduction in CTG length, using modern high-dimensional statistics (machine learning), and a blood and muscle mRNA microarray dataset.

ChemRICH enrichment statistics on lipid classes showed that phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylinositols, ceramides, sphingomyelins and cholesterol esters were found at higher levels in female subjects while triacylglycerols and lysophosphatidylcholines were found at higher levels in male participants across the three cohorts. This strong sex effect on the blood lipidome suggests that specific regulatory mechanisms may exist that regulate lipid metabolism in a different manner between men and women. Cohort studies involving blood lipidomics should consider separate analyses for male and female participants instead of combined analyses treating sex as a confounding factor.","Barupal, D.

125,79176,Addition of Genetics to Quantitative MRI Facilitates Earlier Prediction of Dementia: A Non-invasive Alternative to Amyloid Measures,"BackgroundAlzheimers disease is a major health problem, affecting ~4*5% of people aged 60 and older in 2016 with over 43 million affected globally1. The traditional approach for detection evaluates an individual in the presence of symptoms. However, it has been established that amyloid deposits begin to accumulate years before symptoms begin to appear2,3. With improved technology, there is increased focus on risk reduction, timely diagnosis, and early intervention. Early identification of at-risk individuals may enable patients and their families to better prepare for and reduce the impact of this condition.\n\nMethodsWe obtained data for patients from two longitudinal retrospective cohorts (Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: ADNI and National Alzheimers Coordinating Center: NACC), including T1-weighted MRI and genetics data. The polygenic risk score (PRS) used in this study was built based on a published Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) that identified variants associated with Alzheimers disease. Quantitative MRI features were obtained using a 3D U-Net neural network for brain segmentation. Cox proportional hazards (CPH) regression models were used with subjects censored at death or the last evaluation. Time-to-event was defined as the time it takes for an individual who is dementia-free at the baseline MRI to progress to dementia as defined by the criteria described by ADNI. Time-dependent ROC areas under curve (AUCs) were estimated in the presence of censored data. The time-dependent AUCs were compared among models using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for dependent samples. Data was binned into three groups according to survival probability to eight years after baseline and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the probability of surviving at least to time t. Calibration for both training and validation cohorts was evaluated using the predicted survival probability, splitting samples into five risk groups of equal size based on the predicted survival probability.\n\nFindingsWe developed a model that predicts the onset of dementia over an eight-year time window in individuals with genetics data and a T1-weighted MRI who were dementia-free at baseline. We then validated the model in an independent multisite cohort.\n\nWe observed that models using PRS in addition to MRI-derived features performed significantly better as measured by time-varying AUC up to eight years in both the training (p = 0*0071) and validation (p = 0*050) cohorts. We observed improved performance of the two modalities versus MRI alone when compared with more invasive amyloid measures. The combined MRI and PRS model showed equivalent performance to cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) amyloid measurement up to eight years prior to disease onset (p = 0*181) and while the MRI only model performed worse (p = 0*040). Finally, we compared to amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) three to four years prior to disease onset with favorable results.\n\nInterpretationOur finding suggests that the two modalities are complementary measures, in that MRI reflects near-term decline and the addition of genetics extends the prediction scope of quantitative MRI by adding additional long-term predictive power.\n\nThe proposed multimodal model shows potential as an alternate solution for early risk assessment given the concordance with CSF amyloid and amyloid PET. Future work will include further comparison with amyloid PET (greater than four years) and with CSF (greater than eight years) as additional long-term data becomes available. Also, the model will be evaluated for its clinical utility in the \""active surveillance\"" of individuals who may be concerned about their risk of developing dementia but are not yet eligible for assessment by amyloid PET or CSF.\n\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXT\n\nEvidence before this studyThe most significant known genetic factor in Alzheimers disease (AD) is the {varepsilon}4 allele for the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. Carriers of the allele have a three-fold increased risk of developing AD, whereas individuals who are homozygous have a 15-fold increased risk. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many additional genetic variants that are associated with AD. Recent studies have shown that the risk for AD is better predicted by combining effects from several genetic variants into \""polygenic risk scores\"" (PRS). Studies have also demonstrated that the age of onset for AD is better predicted using PRS rather than APOE status alone. Regional brain atrophy, as measured using volumetric MRI, is also an important biomarker for evaluating an individuals risk of developing dementia. Previous predictions have shown that medial temporal lobe atrophy, as measured by a Hippocampal Occupancy Score (HOC) is highly associated with progression from MCI to AD.\n\nAdded value of this studyIn the proposed model, the addition of genetics to MRI data lengthens the time over which the model can predict onset of dementia. The two measures appear to be complementary, with MRI showing near-term decline and genetics providing additional predictive power in the long-term. When compared to more invasive measures of amyloid, which have been shown to have long-term predictive power, we observed equivalent performance to CSF amyloid up to 8 years prior to disease onset and equivalent performance to amyloid PET three to four years prior to disease onset.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceAlthough MRI remains relatively expensive, it is less expensive, less invasive, more accessible, and more commonly available than amyloid PET. Furthermore, MRI is already part of standard clinical practice and this model may be applied to standard clinical MRIs with no additional acquisition required. A recent survey of patients and their caregivers has highlighted a desire for access to better diagnostics, such as amyloid PET, to aid them in long-term legal, financial and healthcare planning. Our model, given the concordance with CSF and amyloid PET could be an alternate solution to fulfill this need. Furthermore, our model could facilitate the \""active surveillance\"" of individuals who are high-risk and thereby enhance the possibility of early intervention.","Schenker-Ahmed, N.

126,79996,THE C99 FRAGMENT OF APP REGULATES CHOLESTEROL TRAFFICKING,"The link between cholesterol homeostasis and the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), and their relationship to the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD) is still unknown. Cellular cholesterol levels are regulated by a crosstalk between the plasma membrane (PM), where most of the cholesterol resides, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the protein machinery that regulates cholesterol resides. This crosstalk between PM and ER is believed to be regulated by lipid-sensing peptide(s) that can modulate the internalization of extracellular cholesterol and/or its de novo synthesis in the ER. Our data here indicates that the 99-aa C-terminal fragment of APP (C99), a cholesterol-binding peptide, regulates cholesterol trafficking between the PM and the ER. In AD models, increases in C99 provoke the upregulation of cholesterol internalization and its delivery to the ER, which in turn result into the loss of lipid homeostasis and the appearance of AD signatures, such as higher production of longer forms of amyloid {beta}. Our data suggest a novel role of C99 as mediator of cholesterol disturbances in AD, and as a potential early hallmark of the disease.","Pera, M.; Larrea, D.; Montesinos, J.; Guardia-Laguarta, C.; Agrawal, R.
