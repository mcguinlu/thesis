- [ ] CPRD analysis with minimum follow-up
- [ ] The tri results should be standarised before calculating direction of effect, because other-wise it is pulling it in the wrong direction
- [ ] Add HMGCR MR to triangulation
- [ ] Fix table in systematic review - see "IMPORTANT" notes
- [ ] Fix estimates in IPD (IHD, imputed)
- [ ] Assess heterogeneity in the IPD to determine use of fixed versus random effects.
- [ ] Double check risk of bias data

- [ ] Basic paired forest plot functionality in robvis
- [ ] Basic triangulate package
- [ ] Reproduce single analysis from Turner using triangulate
- [ ] Deal with acronyms: ensure that they are explained once per chapter so a bit more self-contained, and apply this approach across chapters.
