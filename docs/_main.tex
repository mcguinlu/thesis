% that in LaTeX, any line starting with a % is NOT executed.  Several places below, you have a choice of which line to use
% out of multiple options (eg draft vs final, for PDF vs for binding, etc.)  When you pick one, add a % to the beginning of
% the lines you don't want.

% This is the official option.  Use it for your submission copy and library copy:
\setlength{\textbaselineskip}{22pt plus2pt}
% This is closer spacing (about 1.5-spaced) that you might prefer for your personal copies:

%%%%% CHOOSE YOUR SECTION NUMBERING DEPTH HERE
% You have two choices.  First, how far down are sections numbered?  (Below that, they're named but
% don't get numbers.)  Second, what level of section appears in the table of contents?  These don't have
% to match: you can have numbered sections that don't show up in the ToC, or unnumbered sections that
% do.  Throughout, 0 = chapter; 1 = section; 2 = subsection; 3 = subsubsection, 4 = paragraph...

% The level that gets a number:

  \textbf{Background}\\
  In the UK, an estimated 800000 people are currently living with dementia and this number is expected to double
  by 2040. Despite the number of dementia cases and decades of research, there remains much unknown about
  the pathogenesis and progression of the disease, and, at present, no effective treatment exists to arrest or
  reverse the cognitive decline associated with the condition. In this context, identification of causal relationships
  between modifiable targets and dementia risk is central to the development of evidence-based prevention
  strategies and will be critically important in maintaining the long-term health of the ageing public. Blood lipid
  levels have been implicated in the aetiology of dementia by genetic linkage and functional cell biology studies,
  but current epidemiological evidence has yet to reach a consensus on their role in dementia risk.

Around 850,000 people in the UK live with dementia, and by 2040, nearly twice as many will have the condition. Despite many promising candidates, no cure for dementia currently exists, meaning the focus is on finding ways to prevent the condition. The best way to do this is to find risk factors (characteristics that influence a person's chance of developing a disease) for dementia that we can easily change. Avoiding a risk factor does not guarantee that a person will not develop dementia but makes it less likely. A key risk factor for dementia may be the levels of lipids (fatty substances such as cholesterol) in a person's blood, though not all existing research agrees. The aim of this thesis is to use all available evidence to assess whether blood lipids levels are in fact a risk factor for dementia.

This introductory chapter provides background information on both dementia and blood lipids, and on the potential link between them. It introduces the theory used to frame the research presented here, and then maps the formal aims and objectives of the research project to the relevant chapters of this thesis. Finally, it summarises the outputs (journal articles, presentations and software) that were created as part of this thesis.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

This chapter provides an overview of the broad context of this thesis, introducing the core concepts used throughout and providing some background on each. It briefly discusses the underlying pathologies and diagnosis of dementia, its public health importance, and the current state of treatment and prevention research. It then provides background on blood lipids and lipid-modifying treatments, and summarises the existing evidence on the effect of these exposures on dementia outcomes.

The chapter introduces evidence synthesis as the key framework used to guide the research presented in the remaining chapters. Finally, it outlines the aims, objectives and structure of this thesis, and briefly summarises the contributions to the scientific literature that arose from this research.

\subsection{Definition and underlying pathologies}\label{underlying-pathologies}}

Defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as a ``major neurocognitive disorder'', dementia is a progressive disease which impairs cognitive functions including speech, memory and executive reasoning.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-edition2013diagnostic}{1}} At advanced stage, the condition causes severe behavioral and personality changes,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-cerejeira2012}{2}} cumulating in reduced motor control that affects patients ability to swallow or breathe.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kumar2013}{3}} The condition has several distinct underlying causes, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-burns2009}{4}}

Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for approximately 60-80\% of cases. Characterised by substantial cognitive impairment and difficulty with high level executive function to the extent that it interferes with, it is an insidious disease, within initial onset thought to occur up to 15 years prior to symptomatic presentation.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-robinson2015}{5}} Much remains unknown about Alzheimer's pathogenesis, despite research implicating the ``amyloid hypothesis'',\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-robinson2015}{5}} as a potential mechanism of disease. Under this hypothesis, the build-up of amlyoid plaques (composed mainly of amlyoid-\(\beta\) peptide) and neurofibrillary tangles (composed mainly of tau protein) triggers a range of physiological changes, including inflammation and cell death, that result in cognitive impairment.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-robinson2015}{5}}

Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second largest underlying pathology of dementia, accounting for \textasciitilde10\% of cases. Vascular dementia is caused by a range of cerebrovascular disorders, and as a result, presentation of symptoms can vary widely.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-iadecola2013}{6}} Similarly, due to the varied underlying pathophysiology, vascular dementia can either onset quite rapidly following a cerebrovascular event such as a stroke or over a long time-frame due to a series of small infarcts.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-venkat2015}{7}} Vascular dementia regularly co-occurs in patients with Alzheimer's disease.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-iadecola2013}{6}} This presentation is described as ``mixed'' dementia,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-custodio2017}{8}} and occurs in approximately 25\% of cases.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-burns2009}{4}}

The remaining 10-30\% of cases are caused other dementia subtypes (e.g.~Lewy Body dementia, frontotemporal dementia) or by progression of other neurological diseases (e.g.~Parkinson's disease).\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-burns2009}{4}}

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria}{%
\subsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria}}

Dementia is difficult to diagnose, primarily due to its slow onset, in addition to the confusion of initial symptoms with normal ageing.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-robinson2015}{5}} Dementia is diagnosed on the basis of behavioral and cognitive changes as assessed by an experienced clinician, using one of several diagnostic criteria.

\begin{tablenotes}
\item[*] From DSM: Evidence of decline is based on concern of the individual, a knowledgeable informant, or the clinician that there has been a significant decline in cognitive function and a substantial impairment in cognitive performance, preferably documented by standardized neuropsychological testing or, in its absence, another quantified clinical assessment.
\end{tablenotes}
\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

~

One of the most commonly used criteria are those found in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria (Table \ref{tab:diagnosticCriteria-table}).\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-edition2013diagnostic}{1}} These criteria are outlined in Table \ref{tab:diagnosticCriteria-table}, and form the broad definition of a dementia diagnoses, supported by a detailed patient history, evidence from carers and family members, and objective assessments of cognitive ability using neurocognitive tests.

Many cognitive assessment tools exist for the purpose of informing a diagnoses of dementia,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sheehan2012}{9}} with two of the best known of these being the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale. The distinction between these memory scales and diagnostic criteria presented above should be noted. For example, the MMSE is used to provide evidence for part A of the criteria presented in \ref{tab:diagnosticCriteria-table}. Taken alone, it does not indicate the absence or presence of dementia, instead merely indicating cognitive impairment which could be due to another cause (for example, temporary delirium as a result of an infection or surgery).

Differentiating between the underlying causes of a dementia diagnosis is challenging but necessary, as whether the patient has Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia will affect expect progression and potential treatment options available (see Section \ref{intro-treatments}). Cause-specific criteria exist for the diagnosis of dementia sub-types. For example, the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria are commonly used to assess patients for Alzheimer's disease,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-dubois2007}{10}} while vascular dementia is diagnosed using the NINCDS-AIREN criteria.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-roman1993vascular}{11}}

Despite the age-specific incidence and prevalence of dementia remaining relatively constant over time,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-prince2016}{12}} an ageing population is set to create a dementia epidemic, particularly in Westernised countries.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-flier2005}{13}} While approximately 525,000 patients have received a dementia diagnosis, the true number of people currently living with dementia in the UK is thought to be closer to 850,000, with this figure expected to double by 2040.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-baker2019}{14}} Globally, the prevalence of dementia is expected to reach 75 million by 2030.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-prince2016}{12}} Dementia is the leading cause of death in the UK, and the only once without a proven treatment.

Dementia also has a substantial economic impact. In 2015, the estimated total cost of dementia in England was £24.2 billion. Health care costs alone were £3.8 billion,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wittenberg2019}{15}} Globally, the cost of dementia care is expected to rise to \$1tr by 2030.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-prince2014dementia}{16}}

As such, the urgent need to reduce the burden of dementia, both at the personal and system level, is clear.

\hypertarget{intro-treatments}{%
\subsection{Treatments}\label{intro-treatments}}

Developing treatments for dementia is regularly deemed to be one of the hardest markets in the pharmaceutical world, with trials of seemingly promising therapeutics being regularly abandoned due to futility.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-cummings2020}{17}}. At present, there are no known curative treatments for dementia, regardless of the underlying cause, though several available therapeutics can help alleviate the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

The most common of these are acetylcholinesterase (ACE) inhibitors, which inhibit the degradation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine by competitively binding the ACE enzyme. Acetylcholine plays a key role in controlling the cholingeric synapses, which are highly concentrated in regions of the brain (such as the neocortex) that control higher level brain functions such as memory and attention.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-hampel2018}{18}} Commonly prescribed ACE inhibitors include donepezil and galantamine.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-pariente2008}{19}} ACE inhibitors increase the availability of the neurotransmitter, and has shown clinical effect is easing the behavioural and memory-related symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-marucci2020}{20}} ACE inhibitors represent only a stop-gap treatment, treating the symptoms rather than the underlying pathology which may continue to progress.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-francis2010}{21}}

\hypertarget{risk-factors}{%
\subsection{Risk factors}\label{risk-factors}}

Given the substantial burden that dementia represents and the absence of any curative therapies, as detailed in the above sections, the assessment of easily modifiable targets for their utility in the prevention of dementia should be prioritized.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-winblad2016a}{22}} To date, a substantial amount of research has been produced examining putative risk factors for dementia.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-feingold2000}{23}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-ansteya}{25}}

The benefits of a prevention-based approach based on addressing these risk factors are well-studied. Reducing the prevalence of the seven most important risk factors for dementia (obesity, hypertension,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-hughes2020association}{26}} diabetes, smoking, physical inactivity, and low educational attainment) by 10-20\% per decade is estimated to result in a reduction in dementia prevalence of 8-15\% by 2050.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-norton2014potential}{27}}

In this context, lipid levels represent a promising target for preventative treatment, due to the ready availability of lipid-modifying treatments which could be repurposed.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-pushpakom2019a}{28}} Determining whether variations in lipid levels are causative for dementia may prove critical in reducing the future burden of the condition.

This thesis will focus on blood lipids as the primary risk factor of interest. The next section provides an overview of blood lipid fractions and therapeutic interventions that modify them, while Section \ref{evidence-association} provides an overview of the existing evidence for an association between lipids and dementia outcomes.

\hypertarget{serum-lipids}{%
\section{Serum lipids}\label{serum-lipids}}

\hypertarget{lipid-fractions}{%
\subsection{Lipid fractions}\label{lipid-fractions}}

The blood lipid profile contains a range of component parts, or fractions. However, this thesis will only consider the two most important fractions, trigylcerides (TG) and cholesterol, which are either absorbed from food (exogenous lipids) or produced internally (endogenous lipids).\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-feingold2000}{23}}

Triglycerides are the simplest and most common type of lipids found across the body. They are used to store unused calories from food, and to move energy around the body.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-laufs2020}{29}} In contrast, cholesterol is primarily used to create cell walls and certain sex hormones.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-zampelas2019}{30}} As lipids are not water soluble, within the blood stream, cholesterol is transported in lipoprotein structures of varying densities. Low-Density-Lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c), commonly know as the ``bad'' cholesterol, transports fat to cells, acting as an energy conveyor. In contrast, High Density-Lipoprotein-cholestel (HDL-c), transports cholesterol to the liver to be broken down and excreted.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-feingold2000}{23}}

In addition to the individual fractions, total serum cholesterol (TC) is a commonly-used summary measure to estimate the total amount of lipid present in the blood. The measure is derived from measurements of the individual HDL-c, LDL-c and TG levels using the Friedwald formula:\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-friedewald1972}{31}}

\[TC \approx LDLc - HDLc - kTG\]
where \(k\) is 0.20 if measurements are in milligrams per decilitre (\emph{mg/dl}) and 0.45 if measured in millimole per litre (\emph{mmol/l}).

Widely-used ranges for the acceptable levels of different types of lipids are based on the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-national2002third}{32}}, and are outlined in Table \ref{tab:lipidLevels-table}.

Elevated LDL-c in the bloodstream, a condition also known as hypercholesterolaemia or hyperlipidaemia,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-nelson2013}{33}} can lead to atherosclerosis,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-libby2019}{34}} the build-up of fatty deposits in the blood vessels. These deposits constrict blood flow and can lead to vascular complications. Alternatively, part of the deposit can detach from the artery walls, forming a clot that can lead to a heart attach or stroke.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-libby2019}{34}} Globally, the prevalence of elevated cholesterol was estimated by the World Health Organisation to be approximately 40\%.

\hypertarget{statins}{%
\subsection{Statins}\label{statins}}

Statins are a commonly prescribed method of lipid regulation.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-collins2016}{35}} Statins inhibit the conversion of 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-Coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) into mevalonic acid, by competitively binding with HMG-CoA Reductase (HMG-CoA-R). This conversion limits the rate at which cholesterol can be produced, enabling statins to effectively reduce the production of LDL cholesterol.





\hypertarget{other-lipid-regulating-agents-lra}{%
\subsection{Other lipid regulating agents (LRA)}\label{other-lipid-regulating-agents-lra}}

There are a range of other interventions that can be used to modify a persons lipid profile, which each acting in slightly different ways (Table \ref{tab}). However, in general, these treatments are either used as adjunct (additional) treatments with statins therapy or are used in situations where statins are contra-indicated or not tolerated.

The most commonly used non-statin therapeutic is ezetimibe,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kosoglou2005}{36}} which prevents intestinal absorption of cholesterol. However, when used alone, it has a limited LDL-c lowering effect, leading to the creation of combined statin/ezetimibe therapies (both compounds contained in a single pill, as opposed to complimentary treatments).\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-genest2006}{37}}

A second example are fibrates, used to treat hypertriglyceridaemia by reducing production of triglyceride carrying compounds in the liver. They are commonly used in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia if treatment with statins has failed to sufficiently control cholesterol levels.

Finally, PCSK9 inhibitors (or PCSK9i) are a relatively new treatment with strong lipid lowering effects, lauded as a potential alternative to statins.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-chaudhary2017}{38}} Their mechanism of action is to bind to and inhibit PCSK9, which breaks down LDL-c receptors on the surface of the liver, thus allowing more LDL-c to be internalised and broken down.

Other therapies targeting triglycerides exist, including nicotinic acids\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mckenney2004new}{39}} and omega-3-fatty acids,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-skulas-rayannc.2019}{40}} but they far less effective in LDL-c lowering than the therapies described above.

\hypertarget{evidence-association}{%
\section{Evidence for the association between blood lipids and dementia}\label{evidence-association}}

This section provides an overview of the varying sources of evidence on the relationship between blood lipid levels and dementia risk.

\hypertarget{basic-science}{%
\subsection{Basic science}\label{basic-science}}

A role for lipids in the aetiology of the dementia is supported by both genetic linkage studies and functional cell biology studies. The generation of the amyloid plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients is cholesterol dependent,,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-burns2003}{41},\protect\hyperlink{ref-mizuno1999}{42}} while the most established genetic risk factor for late-onset dementia, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), is involved in cerebral cholesterol transport. Several other genes involved in cholesterol transport have also been found to be associated with increased AD susceptibility.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-beecham2014}{43}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-meng2007}{45}}

Despite these results, evidence from the diverse range of epidemiological studies on this topic has been inconclusive.

\hypertarget{observational-studies}{%
\subsection{Observational studies}\label{observational-studies}}

By far the largest source of evidence on the relationship between comes from observational designs. Several studies have examined the relationships between concentrations of serum lipids (total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and triglycerides) and both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia and reported extremely varied results. In some studies, a high serum cholesterol concentration has been found to be associated with an increase in susceptibility to AD,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kivipelto2002}{46}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-whitmer2005}{50}} however others have shown no association,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-li2005a}{51}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-tan2003a}{54}} or a reduced susceptibility.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mielke2005}{55},\protect\hyperlink{ref-reitz2004a}{56}} With regards vascular dementia, decreased levels of HDL-c appear to be associated with increased risk,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-reitz2004a}{56}} while for LDL-c, studies have reported both positive and negative associations.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-reitz2004a}{56},\protect\hyperlink{ref-moroney1999}{57}}

Several previous systematic review of observational studies examining the effect of lipids\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-anstey}{58}} and lipid-regulating agents\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-chu2018b}{59},\protect\hyperlink{ref-poly2020c}{60}} on dementia outcomes have been performed. However, these reviews have several limitations. Many did not consider grey literature sources (see Section \ref{diverse-sources-preprints}). Additionally, many of the reviews of observational studies did not perform any risk-of-bias assessment\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-chu2018b}{59}} or used an outdated assessment tool.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-anstey}{58},\protect\hyperlink{ref-poly2020c}{60}}

\hypertarget{randomised-controlled-trials}{%
\subsection{Randomised controlled trials}\label{randomised-controlled-trials}}

In terms of the central research of this thesis, RCTs of statin therapy can be used to provide indirect evidence for the effect of reducing blood LDL-c levels on dementia risk.

However, RCTs may be infeasible if the outcome of interest is one with a long prodomal period, such as dementia (see Section \ref{underlying-pathologies}), as they would require extremely long and costly follow-up.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-ritchie2015}{61}} It is no surprise then that the two previous trials providing evidence on the effect of statins on dementia risk, identified by a recent Cochrane review,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcguinness2016a}{62}} are in fact trials of statins for the prevention of coronary related outcomes.

While being widely cited, these studies have major limitations that reduce their utility as a source of evidence on the effect of statin treatment on in assessing the impact of lipid-lowering treatment on dementia risk. Firstly, there was no clinical cognitive evaluation of patients to determine a dementia outcome. One of the trials, the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly (PROSPER) trial,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-trompet2010}{63}} reported not on dementia outcomes but on the change in cognitive scores over a mean of 3.2 years. As highlighted in Section \ref{diagnostic-criteria}, a ``change in score'' alone is insufficient to diagnose a dementia outcome. The second trial, the Medical Research Council/British Health Foundation Protection Study,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-2002}{64}} found no effect of simvastatin on dementia (OR: 1.00, 95\% CI: 0.61-1.65), but did not report how the outcome was assessed/recorded within the trial.

Additionally, the two trials did not make any effort to assign an underlying pathology to each case, instead reporting an all-cause dementia outcome. As discussed in Section \ref{underlying-pathologies}, the different underlying pathology of dementia have different mechanisms of action, and so it is not gauranteed that the effect of statins would be consistent across them.

Both trials were also limited by the relatively short follow-up period examined, expected when the primary outcome of the trials were coronary related conditions rather than dementia.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-trompet2010}{63},\protect\hyperlink{ref-2002}{64}} The PROSPER trial had a mean follow-up of 3.2 years, while the MRC/BHF Protection Study estimated risk at 5 years of follow-up. Given the long lag time between non-symptomatic onset of dementia and clinical presentation, it is likely that these durations are insufficient to fully capture the onset of dementia. Finally, as they included only patients at high vascular risk, their generalisability to other settings is limited.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcguinness2016b}{65}}

\hypertarget{mendelian-randomisation}{%
\subsection{Mendelian randomisation}\label{mendelian-randomisation}}

Newer methodological approaches, such as Mendelian randomisation (MR),\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-daveysmith2014}{66}} have also been used to examine the effect of varying lipid levels on dementia risk in an effort to combat the risk of reverse causation and residual confounding inherent to observational studies.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-greenland2000}{67}} In brief, MR uses genetic variants that are both strongly associated with the exposure of interest and are independent from potential confounders to strengthen causal inference.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-daveysmith2014}{66}} The analytic method relies on several assumptions about the instrumental variable (IV),\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-davies2018}{68}} namely that:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the IV is associated with the exposure of interest (the relevance assumption);
\item
  the IV and outcome do not share a common cause (the independence assumption); and
\item
  the IV does not affect the outcome other than via the exposure (the exclusion restriction assumption).
\end{enumerate}

Recent MR studies indicated that genetically determined low levels of LDL-c may cause a reduction in AD risk.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-larsson2017c}{69},\protect\hyperlink{ref-ostergaard2015}{70}} However, the effect was attenuated in sensitivity analysis that exclude the region surrounding the ApoE gene, the strongest known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-kim2009}{71}} Inclusion of ApoE4 variants invalidates the exclusion restriction criteria (Assumption 3, above), as the risk reduction observed may be driven by variants in this region via a pathway independent of lipid levels. This was supported by further MR studies where \emph{ApoE4} variants were intentionally excluded.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-benn2017}{72}}

Despite the increasing number of MR studies examining this topic, no systematic review of this study design as a source of evidence has been performed.

~

In summary, multiple sources of evidence exist on the relationship between statins and dementia. In the next section, I introduce the synthesis of diverse sources of evidence as the theoretical framework used in this thesis.

Multiples forms of evidenc

\hypertarget{theoretical-framework-evidence-synthesis}{%
\section{Theoretical framework: Evidence synthesis}\label{theoretical-framework-evidence-synthesis}}

Evidence synthesis is the process of finding and integrating information from several sources to examine a research question.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-donnelly2018a}{73}} A common tyoe of evidence synthesis is a systematic review, either with or without a meta-analysis.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-chandler2019chapter}{74}}

The results of an evidence synthesis exercise can be used to provide a more definitive answer to that question or, failing that, to highlight gaps in the existing evidence base. The ability to identify these gaps is particularly useful in guiding future research to address questions that have yet to be answered, or to provide an additional source of evidence for an existing question.

This thesis seeks to use an evidence synthesis framework to assess the effect of lipids, and treatments that influence lipid levels, on dementia outcomes.
Specifically, this thesis considers three methodologies within the umbrella term of evidence synthesis:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Inclusion of grey literature
\item
  Triangulation across evidence sources
\item
  Individual patient data meta-analysis
\end{itemize}

These three elements are expanded on below and are used to frame the research presented in the subsequent Chapters.

\hypertarget{diverse-sources-preprints}{%
\subsection{Inclusion of grey literature}\label{diverse-sources-preprints}}

The importance of including grey (or gray) literature in systematic reviews is widely acknowledged. Meta-research studies have demonstrated that systematic reviews excluding grey literature sources overestimate the effect of interventions.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-conn2003}{75}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-hopewell2007}{77}} Common, well-accepted forms of grey literature include conference abstracts and theses.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-lefebvre2019searching}{78}}

A important developing source of grey literature are preprints. Defined by the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) as `scholarly manuscript{[}s{]} posted by the author(s) in an openly accessible platform, usually before or in parallel with the peer review process'\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-committeeonpublicationethicscope2018}{79}}, preprints serve several purposes. They are used to establish primacy when submitting to a journal where the peer-review process may take several months,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-vale2016}{80}} to rapidly disseminate research findings, as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-fraser2020a}{81}} and to make available publications that may not have been accepted elsewhere in an attempt to combat publication bias or the ``file-drawer'' effect.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rosenthal1979}{82}}

One of the major criticisms of using preprints as an evidence source is that they have not yet undergone formal peer review.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-maslove2018}{83},\protect\hyperlink{ref-schalkwyk2020}{84}} However, this approach assigns substantial weight to peer-review as a indicator of ``quality'', and is at odds with the acceptance of non-reviewed conference proceedings as an evidence source.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-lefebvre2019searching}{78},\protect\hyperlink{ref-mahood2014}{85}} The argument for including preprints as an evidence source is further strengthened by results that demonstrate preprinted studies seldom change following peer review. Meta-studies of the concordance between preprinted and published studies showed that results were broadly comparable between the two, indicating that while the numerical results may change, the overall interpretation of the results were consistent in the majority of cases.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-shi2021a}{86}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-nicholson2021}{88}} This indicates that preprints should be considered a reliable reflection of a given study.

In this thesis, preprints are considered an important source of evidence, in contrast to previous reviews on this topic. However, as with many sources of grey literature,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mahood2014}{85}} there are several logistical issues with carrying out systematic searches in preprint repositories. As such, to enable the inclusion of preprints in the systematic review described in Chapter \ref{sys-rev-heading}, a new tool addressing these issues is presented in Chapter \ref{sys-rev-tools}.

\hypertarget{triangulating-across-study-designs}{%
\subsection{Triangulating across study designs}\label{triangulating-across-study-designs}}

As illustrated in Section \ref{evidence-association}, several diverse epidemiological methods have been used to examine the effect of varying blood lipid levels on dementia risk. However, each method is limited by its own unique biases. Aetiological triangulation is a developing evidence synthesis method that seeks to exploit these inherent differences in study design, and as a result, in biases.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-lawlor2016a}{89}} If several sources of evidence are available and point towards identical conclusions about a exposure-outcome relationship, and these sources are at risk of unrelated biases, this strengthens our confidence in the result. The ideal scenario is where predicted sources of bias are likely to be in competing directions, one expected to increased the effect of the exposure and the other to attenuate it.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-lawlor2016a}{89}} As such, triangulating these results can provides us a middle-ground between the competing directions of bias. A triangulation approach can also prove useful in a prospective manner, helping to design new studies that are at risk of different sources of bias to that already available from the published literature.

This thesis seeks to apply a triangulation approach to provide the best available evidence on the effect of lipids, and lipid regulating agents, on dementia outcomes.

All existing evidence, regardless of study design, is first identified by the by the systematic review presented in Chapter \ref{sys-rev-heading}. Risk-of-bias assessment using a domain-based tool is already a recommended part of the systematic review process, but is particularly important to a triangulation exercise.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-Pagen71}{90}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcguinness2018}{92}} As such, a core component of the review is a comprehensive domain-based risk-of-bias assessment for all included studies.

Finally all evidence, both pre-existing and produced as part of this thesis (Chapter \ref{cprd-analysis-heading} and \ref{ipd-analysis-heading}), are triangulated in Chapter \ref{dicussion-heading}.

\hypertarget{individual-patient-data-meta-analysis}{%
\subsection{Individual patient data meta-analysis}\label{individual-patient-data-meta-analysis}}

Individual patient data meta-analyses are commonly held to represent the gold standard in evidence synthesis methodology.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-riley2010}{93},\protect\hyperlink{ref-stewart1993}{94}} IPD methods seek to obtain the raw data from each study identified in a systematic review, rather than basing the meta-analysis on summary results extracted from the literature.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-riley2010}{93}}

In the context of this thesis, if lipids are found to have a causal role in development of dementia, evidence-based preventative strategies would be best informed by identifying the types of individuals who are most likely to receive benefit from treatment with lipid-modifying agents.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-arain2009}{95}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-mccartney2016}{97}} However, if primary studies do not presenting results stratified by covariates of interests, meta-analyses of summary-level data on this topic often have limited ability to examine research questions related to exposure-covariate interactions.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-riley2010}{93}} In terms of this thesis, patient sex is considered to be of particular interest.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-arain2009}{95},\protect\hyperlink{ref-letenneur1999}{98}}

An IPD meta-analysis of lipid levels on dementia outcomes would overcome this limitation of summary-level data, as access to the raw data allows for an analysis that investigates these interactions.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-riley2020}{99}} This approach has the added benefit of allowing a common set of inclusion criteria and statistical model to be applied across all dataset, potentially eliminating some important sources of heterogeneity.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-stewart2002}{100}}

Despite their advantages, IPD meta-analysis are rarely performed.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-tugwell2010}{101}} Factors limiting their uptake include the increased time and effort they require when compared to a summary-level analysis, and the low success rate associated with obtaining the raw data.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-nevitt2017a}{102},\protect\hyperlink{ref-ventresca2020}{103}} The data underlying primary studies is frequently not publicly available,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-alsheikh-ali2011}{104},\protect\hyperlink{ref-federer2018a}{105}} and the availability of data ``available on request from authors'' declines rapidly over time.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-vines2014}{106}} Several systematic barriers to open data sharing have been identified\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-vanpanhuis2014a}{107}}. Of particular concern for biomedical IPD analyses are legal issues surrounding the sharing of medical data, motivated by concerns around patient privacy.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wartenberg2010}{108}}

In response to these limitations, new collaborative initiatives have developed to enable rapid access to relevant data in a secure supported workshop. The most import in relation to this thesis is the Dementia Platform UK (DPUK),\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-bauermeister2020}{109}} which aims to provide access to several dementia-related datasets via a single simplified application process.

This thesis will attempt to obtain the raw data from relevant primary studies identified by the systematic review in Chapter \ref{sys-rev-heading}. Any data obtained will be combined with that available from the DPUK portal as part of an individual participant data meta-analysis in Chapter \ref{ipd-analysis-heading}, enabling the assessment of the effect of lipids on dementia stratified by key variables such as sex.

\chapter{medrxivr: an R package for systematically searching biomedical preprints}\label{sys-rev-tools-heading}}

\minitoc 

\hypertarget{lay-summary-1}{%
\section{Lay summary}\label{lay-summary-1}}

Preprints are copies of academic manuscripts that are posted online in advance of being formally published by an academic journal. They represent an important source of scientific literature. A new software program called \texttt{medrxivr} was created to allow researchers to find preprints related to their research in a transparent and reproducible way. Development of this tool was an essential part of this thesis, as preprints represent a key source of information needed for the research reported in future chapters.

\hypertarget{sys-rev-tools-intro}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{sys-rev-tools-intro}}

Preprints represent an increasingly important source of scientific information (see Section \ref{diverse-sources-preprints}). As a result, repositories of preprinted articles should be considered a distinct but complementary information source when reviewing the evidence base as part of a systematic review. The two key repositories in the health science are bioRxiv, established in 2013,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sever2019}{111}} and medRxiv, which evolved to replace the ``Epidemiology'' and ``Clinical Trial'' categories of bioRxiv, which launched in 2019.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rawlinson2019}{110}}

Searching these preprints as part of the systematic review described in Chapter \ref{sys-rev-heading} was a necessity, as many of the existing reviews on the topic of lipids and dementia have not considered this important source of grey literature. At the time of writing, however, the bioRxiv and medRxiv websites allow only simple search queries as opposed to the often complex Boolean logic (AND/OR/NOT) that information specialists use to query other major databases.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-bramer2018a}{113},\protect\hyperlink{ref-gusenbauer2020}{114}} Additionally, the best available extraction mechanism for obtaining references for all records returned by a search were to go through each record, one-by-one, downloading individual citations. As the scale of these preprint databases increase, particularly in light of the massive expansion of the medRxiv repository as a result of COVID, this already time-consuming and error-prone method is no longer feasible.

This chapter outlines the development and key functionality of \texttt{medrxivr} (version 0.0.5), a tool created to facilitate the searching of medRxiv and bioRxiv preprints. The factors that necessitated the development of this tool in the context of this thesis are outlined, and the use of \texttt{medrxivr} in external projects and by other researchers is discussed. As the majority of work on this aspect of this thesis is represented by lines of code (available at \url{https://github.com/ropensci/medrxivr}) this Chapter is an intentionally short, high-level summary of the work done on this project. The GitHub repository for the \texttt{medrxivr} contains a complete record of the development of this tool, including discussion with other members of the systematic review community.

\section{Development}\label{development}}

\hypertarget{success-criteria}{%
\subsection{Success criteria}\label{success-criteria}}

The tool was developed to meet three success criteria,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wateridge1995}{115}} influenced both by the functionality required to perform systematic searches as part of the review in Chapter \ref{sys-rev-heading}, discussion with information specialist colleagues, and an informal survey of the evidence synthesis and health librarian communities on Twitter. The criteria were as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  reliable, reproducible and transparent search functionality, allowing for Boolean (AND/OR/NOT) operator logic;
\item
  support for bulk export of references returned by the search to a file type that can be readily imported into a reference manager (e.g., \emph{.bib} or \emph{.ris}); and
\item
  automated retrieval of the full-text PDFs of relevant records, similar to the Find Full Text feature offered by EndNote.
\end{enumerate}

~

\hypertarget{alternative-medrxivbiorxiv-interfaces}{%
\subsection{Alternative medRxiv/bioRxiv interfaces}\label{alternative-medrxivbiorxiv-interfaces}}

Prior development of this tool, an audit of existing tools for accessing medRxiv and bioRxiv metadata was conducted. While none address the success criteria described above, two of these tools are useful to consider to highlight the additional functionality that \texttt{medrxivr} contributes.

The first, a platform called Rxivist,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-abdill2019}{116}} allows users to search preprints using keywords. However, the core functionality of the Rxivist platform is focused around exploring the number of times a preprint has been downloaded and/or shared on Twitter, to allow researchers to find the most popular papers related to their topic. The search interface\footnote{Available at \url{https://rxivist.org/}} does not allow for complex search strategies using Boolean operators and there is no option to batch-export the results of a search.

The second tool, \texttt{search.bioPreprint}, allows users to search for terms across a range of preprint servers, including medRxiv and bioRxiv, but also journals which use a post-publication peer-review process such as F1000Research.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-iwema2016}{117}} However, similar to the Rxivist platform, this tool is designed for researchers aiming to keep up to date with recent developments in their fields rather than systematically assess the entirety of the available literature. As such, the platform only returns the most recent 1,000 records by publication date.

Finally, neither tool provides an easy way to programmatically download a copy of the PDF of relevant preprints as part of the preparation for the full-text screening stage of a systematic review.

~

\hypertarget{early-versions}{%
\subsection{Early versions}\label{early-versions}}

Work on the \texttt{medrxivr} tool began in Summer 2019, and initially consisted of a development of set of R scripts to allow for searching medRxiv and bioRxiv as part of the systematic search outlined in Chapter \ref{sys-rev-heading}. Following interest from other researchers in using the \emph{ad-hoc} web-scraping scripts, additional development work took place in 2019/2020, allowing for improved searching and exporting functionality and the initial version of the \texttt{medrxivr} R package was released in February 2020.

Early versions of the tool had a reliance on scraping data directly from the repository website. Web-scraping is a fragile mechanism for extracting data, as it is entirely dependent on consistent website design and underlying code structure remaining unchanged.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-shaw2002}{118},\protect\hyperlink{ref-laprie1992}{119}}. In the case of \texttt{medrxivr}, constant maintenance work was required to ensure the web-scraping script performed as expected, as the repository website was regularly updated.

However, an Application Programming Interface (API) for the medRxiv and bioRxiv repositories was made public in early 2020 by the institution responsible for managing these preprint repositories, the Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory. This allowed for newer versions of the \texttt{medrxivr} package to engage in active ``fault prevention'' and provide a more robust interface to the data by removing the reliance of web-scraping.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-laprie1992}{119}}

~

\hypertarget{package-infrastructure}{%
\subsection{Package infrastructure}\label{package-infrastructure}}

The \texttt{medrxvir} package was written in R using RStudio,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rcoreteam2019}{120}} and followed development best-practice, including detailed documentation, a robust unit testing framework (99\% of all code lines within the package are formally tested across multiple platforms including Windows, MacOS, and Linux), and in-depth code review by two experienced, independent reviewers.

~

\hypertarget{usage}{%
\section{Usage}\label{usage}}

The \texttt{medrxivr} R package is split into two component parts:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  an interface to the Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory API, which imports medRxiv and bioRxiv metadata into R; and
\item
  a collection of functions for working with the imported metadata, with an explicit focus on searching this data as part of a systematic review or evidence synthesis project.
\end{itemize}

The standard workflow is to download a copy of all metadata contained in the repository, and then to perform searches on this local copy. This is a workaround as the Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory API does not provide any functionality to search the database.

While the package allows for users to search both medRxiv and bioRxiv, as the process is identical for both, the examples in the sections are limited to the medRxiv repository.

~

\hypertarget{installation}{%
\subsection{Installation}\label{installation}}

\texttt{medrxivr} has been released to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), and can be installed with the following code:

~

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"medrxivr"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

~

Alternatively, the development version of the package can be installed from GitHub:

~

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# install.packages("devtools") }
\NormalTok{devtools}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{install\_github}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"ropensci/medrxivr"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

~

\hypertarget{importing-preprint-metadata}{%
\subsection{Importing preprint metadata}\label{importing-preprint-metadata}}

\texttt{medrixvr} provides two ways to access medRxiv data, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:medrxivr-data-sources}. The first, via the \texttt{mx\_api\_content()} function, creates a local copy of all data available from the medRxiv API at the time the function is run.

~

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Get a copy of the database from the live medRxiv API endpoint}
\NormalTok{mx\_data }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{mx\_api\_content}\NormalTok{()  }
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

~

The second, via the \texttt{mx\_snapshot()} function, provides access to a maintained static snapshot of the database, created each morning at 6am using \texttt{mx\_api\_content()}.

~

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Import a copy of the medRxiv data from the snapshot}
\NormalTok{mx\_data }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{mx\_snapshot}\NormalTok{()}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

~

Allowing users of \texttt{medrxivr} to access a maintained snapshot removes any dependency on the API, which can become unavailable during peak usage times. The relationship between the two methods for accessing the data contained in the medRxiv database is summarized in Figure \ref{fig:medrxivr-data-sources}.

~





\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/sys-rev-tools/data_sources} \caption[Overview of \texttt{medrxivr} data sources]{\textbf{Overview of \texttt{medrxivr} data sources:} Users can either access the API directly via \texttt{mx\_api\_content()}, or can import a maintained snapshot of the database, taken each morning at 6am, via the \texttt{mx\_snapshot()} function. Note: due to the size of bioRxiv, only a maintained snapshot of the medRxiv repository is available via \texttt{mx\_snapshot()}.}\label{fig:medrxivr-data-sources}
\end{figure}

~

\hypertarget{performing-a-search}{%
\subsection{Performing a search}\label{performing-a-search}}

Once a local copy of the metadata is created, the first step in searching it is to create a search strategy. Search terms to be combined with the OR operator are contained in vectors (\texttt{c(...)}), while topics to be combined with the AND operator are contained in lists (\texttt{list(\ldots{})}).

~

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Create the search query}
\NormalTok{topic1  }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"dementia"}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{"alzheimer\textquotesingle{}s"}\NormalTok{)  }\CommentTok{\# Combined with OR}
\NormalTok{topic2  }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"lipids"}\NormalTok{,}\StringTok{"statins"}\NormalTok{)        }\CommentTok{\# Combined with OR}

\NormalTok{myquery }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{list}\NormalTok{(topic1, topic2)         }\CommentTok{\# Combined with AND}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

~

For example, when written in standard syntax, the search contained in the \texttt{myquery} object above would be: ``((dementia \textbf{OR} alzheimer's) \textbf{AND} (lipids \textbf{OR} statins))''. There is no limit to the number of search terms that can be included in each topic, nor in the number of topics that can be search for. Search terms can also contain common syntax used by systematic reviewers and health librarians, including the use of NEAR statements which allows for identification of co-localised terms, and wild-cards, which allow for alternate spellings, e.g.~``randomi\emph{s}ation'' vs ``randomi\emph{z}ation''.

Once a strategy has been defined, it is passed along with the local copy of the database to the \texttt{mx\_search()} function.

~

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# Run the search}
\NormalTok{results }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{mx\_search}\NormalTok{(mx\_data,}
\NormalTok{                     myquery)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

~

\hypertarget{refining-your-search}{%
\subsection{Refining your search}\label{refining-your-search}}

An important argument of the \texttt{mx\_search()} is \texttt{report}, which outputs a structured table with each search strategy presented on an individual line and the number of records associated with this strategy. \textbf{{[}CITATION NEEDED - PRISMA-S{]}}

~

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{results  }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{mx\_search}\NormalTok{(mx\_data,}
\NormalTok{                      myquery, }\CommentTok{\# Combined with OR}
                      \AttributeTok{report =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DocumentationTok{\#\# Found 1 record(s) matching your search.}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# }
\DocumentationTok{\#\# Total topic 1 records: 224}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# dementia: 224}

\DocumentationTok{\#\# Total topic 2 records: 119}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# lipids: 90}
\DocumentationTok{\#\# statins: 33}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

~

This allows users to discover which terms in their search are contributing most to the total number of results returned. This is important as part of developing a search strategy,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-bramer2018}{121}} as it allows for the key terms related to each topic to be discovered. It also aids in identifying misspelled or case-sensitive search terms, which will frequently return no results. As an example, in the search presented above, the term ``alzheimer's'' returns no records. This is expected, as ``Alzheimer'' is a proper noun and so should be capitalised, but serves to illustrate the usefulness of the reporting function.

~

\hypertarget{exporting-to-a-bibliography-file}{%
\subsection{Exporting to a bibliography file}\label{exporting-to-a-bibliography-file}}

In line with the second success criteria (Section \ref{success-criteria}), one of the key features of the \texttt{medrxivr} is the ability for users to easily export the results of their systematic search to a reference manager. While it is a seemingly simple request, this is is one of the key ways in which \texttt{medrxivr} is set apart for other preprint search tools, including the native medRxiv/bioRxiv website search functionality.

For example, the results of our simple search above can be exported to the \texttt{"medrxiv\_export.bib"} file using the following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mx\_export}\NormalTok{(results, }
          \AttributeTok{file =} \StringTok{"medrxiv\_export.bib"}\NormalTok{,}
          \AttributeTok{report =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

~

\hypertarget{downloading-the-pdfs-of-relevant-records}{%
\subsection{Downloading the PDFs of relevant records}\label{downloading-the-pdfs-of-relevant-records}}

\texttt{medrxivr} alos allows users to download the full text papers for records that are deemed eligible for full-text screening (see Figure \ref{fig:medrxivr-sr}). \texttt{mx\_download()} takes the list of included records and saves the PDF for each to a folder specified by the user. This functionality is similar to the ``Find Full Text'' feature offered by EndNote.

~

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{mx\_download}\NormalTok{(results,  }\CommentTok{\# Search results, less excluded records}

The package was been onboarded into the rOpenSci suite of packages, a collection of ``carefully vetted, staff- and community-contributed R software tools that lower barriers to working with scientific data sources on the web''.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-boettiger2015}{126}} As part of this process, following rigorous peer-review, an associated article introducing the tool was published by the Journal of Open Source Software.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcguinness2020a}{127}} The entire review discussion is publicly available and can be viewed online.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/380}} The tool has also been well received by the open-source community, demonstrated by the engagement of other developers in contributing to important new functionality and suggesting bug-fixes.

Lobbying of the Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory to develop the API to allow for direct searching of the database has been ongoing. This would negate the current need to download a local copy of the relevant preprint database before searching it, which is currently the rate limiting step for performing searches. For example, as of January 2021, downloading a copy of the bioRxiv database takes approximately an hour.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Limitations of \texttt{medrxivr}}{Limitations of medrxivr}}\label{limitations-of-medrxivr}}

While searching of the medRxiv and bioRxiv databases was crucial for the systematic review element of this thesis presented in Chapter \ref{sys-rev-heading}, there are some important limitations to note here. A key example is that the tool only searches the available metadata of preprint records (the title, abstract and keywords), rather than the full text of preprints, meaning some relevant records might be missed. However, this approach echoes that used by other search platforms such as OvidSP, and while some relevant records may be missed (reduced sensitivity), limiting the search to the metadata fields prevents non-relevant records from being returned (high specificity). A key example of the reduced specificity when searching the full text, identified during development of \texttt{medrxivr}, is that a search for ``dementia'' would return a record where the only occurrence of this term is in the title of one of the references.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-bong2019}{128}}

There is also the potential that the cross-section of literature posted on medrxiv/bioRxiv is substantially different from the true grey literature (studies or analyses that are not published for a range of reasons including results that are not deemed ``novel'' or are not statistically significant).\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-song2010}{129}} This is because simply lowering the barriers to publication may well encourage authors to published ``null'' results, but due to the effort involved in writing up a distributable manuscript, it is unlikely to completely address the ``file drawer'' effect.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rosenthal1979}{82}} It is likely too early (and likely too methodologically difficult) to tell whether the increased popularity and acceptance of preprint repositories will have any effect of the availability of research that was not considered ``publishable'' at other venues.

\subsection{Role of open source tools in evidence synthesis}\label{role-of-open-source-tools-in-evidence-synthesis}}

Part of the motivation for creating the \texttt{medrxivr} tool was a belief that the development and distribution of open source scripts and tools should be a fundamental part of evidence synthesis research.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-goldacre2019b}{130},\protect\hyperlink{ref-mckiernan2016c}{131}} In the case of \texttt{medrxivr}, it is likely that several other evidence synthesists had written personal scripts that have a similar, or related, functionality - in fact, following development of the tool, I identified one other researcher that has done so (Nicholas Fraser, author of the \texttt{rbiorxiv} package, which allows for importing medRxiv metadata into R but does not provide search functionality).\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rbiorxiv}{132}} If these scripts continue to be developed in private and are never shared or publicised, this will inevitably harm to the evidence synthesis community, not only in terms of duplication of time and effort but also due to lost opportunities for collaboration.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mckiernan2016c}{131}} Creating and sharing well-documented packages, the recognised standard for sharing code in R, represents one way to reduce this inefficiency.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-vuorre2020}{133}}

  I have outlined the motivation for developing this tool in relation to this thesis - more specifically, that it was used to perform systematic and reproducible searches of a key literature sources used in the comprehensive systematic review described in Chapter \ref{sys-rev-heading}.
\item
  I have contrasted \texttt{medrxivr} with other available interfaces to medRxiv/bioRxiv data to highlight the added functionality it offers. I have also discussed the tools reception to date, its limitations, and the important role of open-source tools like \texttt{medrxivr} in evidence synthesis.

The aim of this chapter is to systematically review all available literature on the association between blood levels of total cholesterol and it's constituent parts (HDL-c,LDL-c and triglycerides) on the subsequent risk of dementia.

Based on the review of existing literature, no previous evidence synthesis exercise attempted to examine all available literature simultaneously.

Only by looking across all available evidence can the true, given the often limited use of one type of evidence (RCTs are hard to do, obs studies are biased).

\subsection{Search strategy}\label{search-strategy}}

I systematically search electronic bibliographic databases to identify potentially relevant records. The search strategy used in each database was developed in an iterative manner using a combination of free text and controlled vocabulary (MeSH/EMTREE)\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-lefebvre2019searching}{78}} terms to identify studies which have examined the relationship between blood lipids levels and dementia, incorporating input from an information specialist. The strategy will include terms related to lipids, lipid modifying treatments, and dementia and its sub-types, and was designed for MEDLINE before being adapted for use in the other bibliography databases listed. An outline of the general strategy is presented in the Table \ref{tab:searchOverview-table} below and the full draft search strategies for each database are presented in Appendix \ref{appendix-search-strategy}.

To ensure that the study design filters are not excluding potentially relevant records, a random sample of 500 records identified by the main search but excluded by the filters (defined as ``8 NOT 14'' in Table \ref{tab:searchOverview-table}) was screened. If any potentially relevant studies are identified, their titles and abstracts were searched for key terms that can be incorporated into the filters to improve search sensitivity.

The following databases will be searched from inception onwards: Medline, EMBASE, Psychinfo, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science Core Collection (for the specific databases available thi via the Univeristy ). We will also search clinical trial registries, for example ClinicalTrials.gov, to identify relevant randomized controlled trials. As the contents of the Web of Science Core COllection can vary by institution, the specific database searched via this platform are listed in Appendix \ref{appendix-wos-databases}.

The abstracts list of relevant conferences (e.g.~the proceedings of the Alzheimer's Association International Conference, published in the journal Alzheimer's \& Dementia) will be searched.
Grey literature will also be searched via ProQuest, OpenGrey and Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index, while theses will be accessed using the Open Access Theses and Dissertations portal. We will also search bioRxiv and medRxiv, preprint repositories using a tool built as part of this thesis, to identify potentially relevant studies. Finally, the reference lists of included studies will be searched by hand while studies citing included studies will be examined using Google Scholar (forward and reverse citation searching).

\hypertarget{study-selection}{%
\subsection{Study selection}\label{study-selection}}

Records weree imported into Endnote and deduplicated using the method outlined in Bramer et al.~(2016).\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-bramer2016}{136}} In summary, this method uses multiple stages to identify potential duplicates, beginning with automatic deletion of records matching on multiple fields (``Author'' + ``Year'' + ``Title'' + ``Journal''), followed by manual review of less similar articles (e.g.~those matched based on the ``Title'' field alone).

Screening (both title/abstract and full-text) was performed using a combination of Endnote, a citation management tool,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-hupe2019}{137}} and Rayyan, a web-based screening application.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-ouzzani2016}{138}} Title and abstract screening to remove obviously irrelevant records was performed primarily by the primary author, with a random selection of excluded records being screened in duplicate to ensure consistency with the inclusion criteria.

Full-text screening will also be completed in full by the primary author. A second reviewer will screen a random sample of included and excluded records, in addition to any records identified by the first reviewer as being difficult to assess against the inclusion criteria. Reasons for exclusion at this stage will be recorded. Disagreements occurring during either stage of the screening process will be resolved through discussion with a senior colleague. A PRIMSA flow diagram will be produced to document how records moved through the review.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-zotero-766}{139}}

\hypertarget{inclusion-criteria}{%
\subsubsection{Inclusion criteria}\label{inclusion-criteria}}

We will seek studies that examine the relationship between blood lipid levels (or any specific lipid fraction, including total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides) and risk of incident dementia/MCI. Eligible study designs include randomized controlled trials and non-randomized observational studies of lipid modifying treatments, longitudinal studies examining the effect of increased/decreased blood lipid levels, and genetic instrumental variable (Mendelian randomization) studies examining the effect of genetically increased/decreased blood lipid levels.

Participants will be free (or assumed to be free) of dementia/MCI at baseline. Studies of any duration will be included to allow for exploration of the effect of length of follow-up on the effect estimate using meta-regression. No limits will be placed on the sample size of included studies.

Eligible studies will define dementia according to recognised criteria, for example the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Association-Internationale pour la Recherche en l'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN), International Classification of Diseases (ICD), or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria. For MCI, eligible studies are those that attempted state a definition for diagnoses of MCI (e.g.~an adapted version of the Petersen criteria)\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-petersen1999}{140}} and create ordinal groups of patients (e.g.~no dementia or dementia/MCI/dementia) based on this definition.

No limitations will be imposed on publication status, publication date, venue or language, although we will require sufficiently detailed reports of the studies to be able to examine their methods. Preprints and unpublished reports will be eligible for inclusion if relevant. Multiple publications resulting from the analysis of the same data will be included and grouped.

\hypertarget{exclusion-criteria}{%
\subsubsection{Exclusion criteria}\label{exclusion-criteria}}

Case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, qualitative studies, case reports/series and narrative reviews will be excluded. Studies which present no evidence of attempting to exclude prevalent cases from their analyses will also be excluded. Studies that measure change in continuous cognitive measures (e.g.~MoCA score) without attempt to map these scores to ordinal groups (e.g.~no dementia/MCI/dementia) will be excluded. Conference abstracts with no corresponding full-text publication will be examined, and we will contact authors to obtain information on the study's status. Studies that are reported in insufficient detail (e.g.~only in conference abstracts, new, letters, editorials and opinion) will be excluded. Previous systematic reviews will not be eligible, but their reference lists will be screened to identify any potentially relevant articles. Studies with outcomes not directly related to the clinical syndrome of dementia (e.g., neuroimaging), studies implementing a ``multi-domain intervention'' where the lipid-regulating agent is included in each arms (e.g.~for example, a study examining exercise + statins vs statins alone, but a study examining exercise + statins vs exercise alone would be included), and studies where there was no screening for dementia at baseline except if the sample was initially assessed in mid-life (i.e.~below the age of 50) will be excluded.

\hypertarget{assessment-of-inter-rater-reliability}{%
\subsubsection{Assessment of inter-rater reliability}\label{assessment-of-inter-rater-reliability}}

Inter- and intra-rater reliability was assessed for a 10\% sub-sample of records at the title and abstract screening stage. Intra-rater reliability involved a single reviewer applying the inclusion criteria to the same set of records while blinded to their previous decisions, while inter-rater reliability involved two reviewers independently screening the same set of records.

If this approach demonstrates a significant level of erroneous exclusion by the primary author a larger proportion will be dual-screened.

Rater reliability was assessed using Gwet's agreement coefficient (AC1).\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-gwet2008}{141}} This measure of inter-rater reliability was chosen over other methods of assessing inter-rater reliability such as percent agreement (number of agreements divided by total number of assessments) as i account for chance agreement between reviewers but does not suffer from severely imbalanced marginal totals in the same way that Cohen's kappa value does.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-gwet2008}{141}}

Gwet's AC1 is defined as

\[AC1 = \frac{observed\;agreement-chance\;agreement}{1-chance\;agreement}\]

In reference to a two-by-two table with cells A, B, C and D, it is calculated using the following:

\[AC1 = \frac{\frac{A+D}{N}-e(\gamma)}{1-e(\gamma)}\]

where \(e(\gamma)\) is the chance agreement between raters, given as \(2q(1-q)\), where

\[q = \frac{(A+C)+(A+B)}{2N}\]

How to interpret agreement co-efficients is widely debated. Here we use guidelines based on a stricter interpretation of the Cohen's Kappa coefficient,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mchugh2012}{144}} presented in Table \ref{tab:gwet-table}.

\hypertarget{data-extraction}{%
\subsection{Data extraction}\label{data-extraction}}

Harmonization of cholesterol measures across studies was performed, as different studies used different methods to quantify exposure, including comparing differing risks in the highest vs lowest quartiles of a lipid, using a binary classification of patients into a hypercholesterolaemia or not, categorizing lipid levels into high, middle, and low groups according to study-defined criteria, and simply treating the exposure as a continuous variable.

Following guidance for a dose response meta-analysis, we picked midpoint for all studies where bands were provided (extremely common in the case of lipids)

This analysis was unusual, as multiple methods of integration and analysis were required with data spanning many forms.

A piloted data extraction for was used. I extracted the data in the first instance and subset was checked by a colleague for accuracy.

Risk of bias assessment was performed using the domain-based risk-of-bias assessment tool appropriate to the study design. Randomized controlled trials were assessed using the RoB2 tool,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sterne2019}{146}},
The tool assess the risk of bias across five domains: Bias arising from the randomization process, Bias due to deviations from intended intervention, Bias due to missing outcome data, Bias in measurement of the outcome, Bias in selection of the reported result.

\subsubsection{Non-randomised studies of interventions/exposures}\label{non-randomised-studies-of-interventionsexposures}}

For non-randomised studies of interventions, I used the ROBINS-I (Risk of bias in non-randomised studies - of interventions) tool.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sterne2016}{147}} This tool assess the risk of bias across seven domains: Bias due to confounding, Bias due to selection of participants, Bias in classification of interventions, Bias due to deviations from intended interventions, Bias due to missing data, Bias in measurement of outcomes, and Bias in selection of the reported result. Similar to the RoB 2, it has a number of prompting questions per domain, with judgements includeing. Ideally, obs studies assesed in reference to an idealised randomised controlled trial. Futher, the rare overall judgement of Low should be considered equivalent to a randomised controlled trial.

I opted to use the ROBINS-E tool, despite it still being in development,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-morganr2020}{148}} in place of other existing published tools such as the Newcastle-Ottowa scale (NOS).\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wells2000newcastle}{149}} There are two primary reasons for this: firstly, current thinking in assessing internal validity has moved away from scales.

non-randomized studies of interventions were assessed using the ROBINS-I tool, and non-randomized studies of exposures were assessed using the ROBINS-E tool.{[}CITE{]}

Secondly, as mentioned in the introduction to this section, using a domain based to assess the risk of bias in studies of exposure allowed for better comparison and consistency across the tool used for different study designs, as they are all domain based.

\textbf{Will need to include something in the methods section on this}

As part of this analysis, we examined the overlap between different published reviews on this topic.

Several primary studies were captured in multiple systematic reviews. However, some studies were not captured by any previous review,

Put upSet plot here.

An upset plot shows the total size of each set (in this case, the set of included studies in each review) in the bottom left hand bar plot. For example, the XXXX review includes XXXX studies.

Where a line joins two points in the matrix, the main barchart shows the number of records shared by these reviews. So for example, XXXX records were captured both by the XXXX review and the XXXX review.

Where the matrix has just a single point highlighted, this shows the records unique to that review.

The reviews are ordered by date, to attempt to show the increasing overlap and total number of studies

Our review is presented as the last point on this plot, and captured XXXX records

The alternative is to have a barplot showing the total cumulative number of records over the years, using our set as the master, with the bars coloured by the number of records included in 1/2/3/4 reviews. The information below the bar axis could then show the number of reviews published in that year, or alternative, you could have an upsidedown bar to show cumulative number of reviews on this topic.

Of note, this review did not include the commonly cited PROSPER study, which examined the effect of pravastatin on CVD risk and putatively provides no evidence for an effect of the statin on dementia outcomes. While widely cited and included in the Cochrane review on this topic, it has not been included here, for the reason that it only reported the change from cognitive score (as measured using the {[}CHECK{]} scale) over a mean follow-up. While this is a useful indicator of general cognitive decline, it is not equivalent to a dementia outcome, as cogntive scales should feed into a broader diagnostic pathway - See section \ref{diagnostic-criteria}

This does introduce some conflicts with other studies where a change score has been dichotomised in order to have a binary dementia or not dementia outcome.

Does it also cause issues in terms of self-report?

\hypertarget{screening-results}{%
\subsection{Screening results}\label{screening-results}}

Following screening, XXX studies were included.

The distribution of included studies over time demonstrates that despite the conduct of several previous reviews of different types of literature surrounding this question, primary studies continue to the published as these reviews have yet to provide a definite answer.

Table \ref{tab:incl-studies-character} shows the characteristics {[}\textbf{Include column here that says whether it was included in a systematic review - see below}{]}

As part of our our forward snowballing exercise (where articles citing an included study are cited), we recorded whether a study included in our review had been included in any previous evidence synthesis attempt in an attempt to qualify the added value of this analysis. Additionally, if an included article was subsequently cited by a review, all studies in that review were screened for inclusion for the sake of completeness. This analysis was performed by extracting the citing articles from Google Scholar on {[}DATE{]} and screening them manually. The DOI of articles extracted from this analysis are included in the appendix, as the Google Scholar search functionality is not readily reproducible.*

As a summary of the duplication of work in this area, we looked at how many reviews a single included study had previously been included in.

For the inter-rater reliability, percentage agreement was 97.3\% (AC1 = XXXX, Table \ref{tab:agreement-table-intra}), while for the intra-rater reliability, agreement was 98.6\% (AC1 = XXXX, Table \ref{tab:agreement-table-intra}).

The discrepancy between the percent agreement and the associated value of AC is expected, due to the heavy imbalance in this sample towards exclusion.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-feinstein1990}{152}}

Those records which were excluded in the initial screening, but were included either by the same reviewer on their second viewing (n=4), or by the second reviewer (n=29), were investigated. This discrepancy between the two reviewers was explained in all cases by differing interpretations of the inclusion criteria, specifically around the definition of cognitive decline versus mild cognitive impairment, and the definition of eligible lipids fractions.

A common theme across the studies was a lack of data on vascular dementia. This is particularly interesting as lipids and statins are primarily a vascular disease. There is the potential that they studies encountered similar difficulties in address the unexpected results observed in the CPRD analysis in Chapter \ref{cprd-analysis-heading}. For vascular dementia, few studies exmined this outcome, primarily because of the absence (until recently) of

One item of particular interest in the absence of studies examining Mendelian randomisation studies is the absence of any effect following the adjustment for Apoe4. As covered in the discussion, ApoE4 genotype is the mjor risk factor for Alzheimer's disease.

A key limitation for other types of dementia, in particularly vascular, is that there has yet to be a GWAS identifying relevant SNPS that could then be used in a MR study with SNPS for lipids to estimates the causal effect of lipids on vascular dementia {[}\textbf{Is this true?}{]} This rules out the use. In addition, there was limited literature available - as discussed in CHapter \ref{sys-rev}

Consideration of the potential impact of the magnitude and direct of residual confounders/bias is not a major stretch from what is already happening in the assessment of the quality of evidence (GRADE) framework. Within GRADE, the overall quality of evidence can be upgraded when there is deemed to be unmeasured or residual confounding variables which reduce the. For example, if the propensity to treatment is related to comorbidity burden, but those on treatment still have better outcomes then those on control, it is likely that the true effect of the intervention is being underestimated.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-guyatt2011}{153}}

A final point on the progress of the review is that, due to the need for dual screening and data extraction, a number of external researchers became involved in this review. I found the people-management aspect particularly challenging and could definitely have improved the process through better communication of deadlines, but it has provided good experience of leading a review team.

As part of this review, I have not only performed a original search of primary literature databases, but have also screened the reference lists of comparable reviews to ensure no study has been omitted.
\item
  \emph{Structured risk of bias assessment:} The majority of the highly cited reviews on this topic either do not formally consider the risk of bias in the observational studies they include or do not use an appropriate domain-based assessment tool (e.g.~ROBINS-I/E). This is important area in which this thesis can add value, as based on the risk-of-bias assessments I have performed to date, several primary studies are at high risk of bias and this should be reflected in the findings of any review on this topic.
\item
  \emph{Inclusion of preprints:} Unlike other available reviews and enabled by the tool described in Chapter 3, this review systematically searched preprinted health-related manuscripts as a source of grey literature. As part of this chapter, I plan to examine the extent of the additional information provided to the review by the inclusion of preprints.

\section{Lay summary}\label{lay-summary-3}}

Electronic health record (EHR) databases are large collections of patients data, used to manage patient administration and care. Under these systems, whenever a patient attends their GP, their clinical data is recorded in a central database using a standard set of codes. These databases have several advantages over traditional methods of data collection, including the number of people they contain and the length of time for which participants are followed. This is particularly important when studying diseases such as dementia, which may begin to develop in patients long before symptoms are seen.

This analysis makes use of the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), which contains the electronic medical records of more than 3 million people from general practices across the UK. Using this data, the analysis presented in this chapter examined the effect of treatment which lower cholesterol levels, such as statins, on the risk of dementia and related outcomes.

No evidence for an effect of lipid regulating agents effect on the risk of Alzheimer's disease was found, with the exception of a slightly increased risk in those prescribed a certain type of drugs called fibrates. In contrast, I found an increased risk of vascular and other (i.e.~non-Alzheimer's) dementia with lipid regulating agent use.

This increased risk is unexpected, and is very likely to be due to the presence of bias in the analysis. This bias, called ``confounding by indication'', is caused when those who are prescribed a statin are more at risk of vascular dementia for a range of reasons, and so it appears as if statins are harmful. However, despite this limitation, the analysis presented provides an important source of information which will be used in later chapters.

\hypertarget{introduction-1}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

In this Chapter, I present the results of an analysis of a large population-based electronic health record dataset to investigate the relationship between lipid regulating agent (LRA) use and dementia outcomes.

The analysis aims to address important two limitations of the current evidence base as identified by the systematic review presented in Chapter \ref{sis-rev-heading}.

Firstly, it explicitly examines vascular dementia as an outcome. The systematic review presented in the previous chapter identified an evidence gap around the effect of lipid regulating agents on the risk of vascular dementia. As triangulation exercises require as many diverse sources of evidence as possible, this analysis provides a source of information on this outcome.

Secondly, and in a similar vein, the analysis intentionally takes a different analytical approach to that most commonly used to examine the effect of statins on dementia (as identified by the systematic review). Specifically, this involved a concerted effort to address immortal time bias though use of a Cox Proportional time-varying treatment indicator. This approach provides a evidence source at risk of a distinct set of biases due to the alternative analytical strategy that will be incorporated into the triangulation exercise presented in Chapter \ref{discussion-heading}.

\hypertarget{cprd-data-source}{%
\subsection{Data source}\label{cprd-data-source}}

Previously known as the General Practice Research Database (GPRD), the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) is a large population-based, electronic health record (EHR) database.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-herrett2015}{166}} The database has been collecting primary care data from participating practices across England since 1987.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-williams2012}{167},\protect\hyperlink{ref-wood2001revitalizing}{168}} It contains the primary care records for more than 10 million primary care patients in England, and is broadly representative of the UK population in terms of age, sex and ethnicity.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-herrett2015}{166},\protect\hyperlink{ref-mathur2014}{169}}

To avoid the ambiguity of interpreting free-text clinical notes and to allow for easy analysis of the resulting data, the CPRD primarily collects data using a predefined coding system known as Read codes.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-booth1994}{170}} All clinical events, included clinical test results and diagnoses, can be identified by a specific Read code. The codes use a nested approach (see Table \ref{tab:readExample-table}), with the initial characters defining broad diagnostic topics (e.g.~Eu\ldots{} - Mental and behavioural disorders), while subsequent characters provide additional information on the specific condition diagnosed (e.g.~Eu001 - Dementia in Alzheimer's disease with late onset).

Lists of relevant codes for each of the index events, exposures and outcomes used in the analysis were created. Each of these are described in more detail in the following sections.

\hypertarget{cohort-definition}{%
\subsection{Cohort definition}\label{cohort-definition}}

This analysis included all participants registered at a participating practice between 1 January 1995 and 29 February 2016 who had a flag for ``research quality'' data. Records pre-dating the 1995 cutoff were included in the original CPRD extract obtained for this analysis. However, these were excluded from the analysis as data quality and reliability is thought to be higher after this date.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wolf2019}{171}} Additionally, individuals with less than 12 months of continuous records prior to cohort entry were excluded, making the effective start date of the cohort 1 January 1996.

Participants were included in the study cohort if their record contained any of the following index events: a Read code for a diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia or related condition; a Read code for prescription of a lipid-regulating agent (such as statins); a total cholesterol test result of \textgreater4 mmol/L; or an LDL-c test result of \textgreater2 mmol/L. These index events allowed me to define a population of participants who were either at risk of hypercholesterolemia, as indicated by the elevated total or LDL cholesterol test results, or had already been diagnosed with it, as indicated by a diagnostic code/related prescription.

All events of interest were identified using predetermined code lists, which are available for inspection from the archived repository accompanying this analysis (data/code availability is discussed in Section \ref{cprd-data-avail}).

The index date for a participant was defined as the date where the first relevant code or test result was recorded on their clinical record, and participants were followed up until the earliest of: an outcome of interest; death; end of follow-up (29 February 2016); or last registration date with their GP practice. Participants were removed from the sample if they were less than 40 years of age, had less than 12 months of ``research quality'' data, were simultaneously prescribed more than one lipid-regulating agent (due to the difficult of assigning these to a single exposure group), or were diagnosed with an outcome of interest before or on the date of the index event (i.e.~had less than one full day of follow-up).

\hypertarget{exposures}{%
\subsection{Exposures}\label{exposures}}

We considered seven lipid-regulating drug classes based on groupings in the British National Formulary (BNF),\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wishart2017}{172}} namely: statins, fibrates, bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe, nicotinic acid groups, ezetimibe and statin (representing one treatment containing both drugs, rather than the two classes being prescribed concurrently), and omega-3 fatty acid groups.

A participant's drug class was assigned based on their first recorded prescription, and any drug switching was ignored in an effort to mimic an intention-to-treat approach. We did however examine how often the initial drug class altered according to one of three criteria:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{stopped}: defined as the last prescription of the primary class being followed by at least six months of observation;
\item
  \textbf{added}: defined as a second drug class being prescribed before the last prescription of the initial class; and

  \textbf{switched}: defined as a second drug class being prescribed after the last prescription of the initial class.

\hypertarget{cprd-outcomes}{%

We considered five outcomes as part of this analysis: probable Alzheimer's disease, possible Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, other dementia, and a composite all-cause dementia outcome. When two or more outcomes were coded in a participant's clinical record, a decision tree was used to differentiate between them (see Figure \ref{fig:decisionTreeFig}). The diagnosis date of the outcome was determined by the first record of a relevant code.

Participants were censored at the earliest of date of: diagnosis; death; transfer out of the study cohort; or end of follow-up (29th February 2016).

~

\hypertarget{covariates}{%
\subsection{Covariates}\label{covariates}}

A range of additional variables were included in the analysis, intended to address the different distributions of potential confounding variables between those who were prescribed an lipid-regulating agent and those who were not.

Demographic covariates adjusted for included age and gender. Age was calculated at date of entry into the cohort. Socioeconomic status was proxied using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 2010, which draws on seven domains (income; employment; education, skills and training; health and disability; crime; barriers to housing and services; living environment) to create an overall deprivation score for each of 32844 statistical geography areas in England. To help preserve patient privacy, IMD score is only available from the CPRD in twentiles, with 1 indicating the least deprived and 20 indicating the most deprived. Smoking and alcohol use was determined at index, and participants were categorised as current, former, or never users of each.

Body mass index (a summary measure calculated as \(weight/height^2\)), baseline total cholesterol and baseline LDL cholesterol measures were obtained, using the last recorded value prior to the index date. A variable indicating grouped year of entry into the cohort (\textless2000, 2000-2004, 2005-2009, \textgreater2010) was included to allow for changes in prescribing trends across the lifetime of the cohort. To assess healthcare utilisation, I adjusted for the average annual number of consultations between the beginning of a patients data and their entry into the cohort.

Finally, presence of a range of related conditions at baseline were accounted for, including cardiovascular disease, coronary bypass surgery, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. In addition to adjusting for these covariates individually, a Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI) score was calculated for each participant. The CCI is a weighted index that uses presence and severity of a number of conditions to enable adjustment for the general health of a participant in terms of their mortality risk.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-charlson1987new}{173}} Inclusion of this index allowed me to attempt to adjust for the general health of patients included in the analysis.

Codelists for all covariates can be found in the archived data repository accompanying this analysis (see Section \ref{cprd-data-avail}).

~

\hypertarget{missing-data}{%
\subsection{Missing data}\label{missing-data}}

Missing data are a recognised issue in electronic health records databases,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wells2013strategies}{174}} given that they contain administrative data, collected primarily for the purposes of patient management and care rather than academic research.

In this analysis, missing data were handled using a multiple imputation approach. Variables with missing observations were identified, and 20 imputed datasets were created.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sterne2009a}{175}} Nominal variables with missing values were modelled using multinomial logistic regression, while continuous variables were modelled using linear regression. As per best practice, all variables used in the analytic model, including the outcome, were included in the imputation model.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-moons2006using}{176}} Imputation was performed using the MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) command in STATA16.

Missing data was only considered an issue for variables where a numerical test result was expected (e.g.~BMI), or where a code existed for the absence of the condition (e.g.~categorical smoking status). This approach was necessary, as absence of a code for other treatments or conditions (e.g.~statin use or dementia) was assumed to indicate absence of the treatment/condition, rather than being considered missing.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wells2013strategies}{174}}

Using multiple imputation to handle missing data is an alternative to a ``complete case'' approach,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-pigott2001review}{177}} where participants missing any covariate are dropped from the dataset. As a sensitivity analysis, I preformed and compared the results of both methods,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-hughes2019a}{178}} to investigate the impact of multiple imputation on the results.

~

\hypertarget{estimation-methods}{%
\subsection{Estimation methods}\label{estimation-methods}}

A Cox proportional hazards (PR) model was used to estimate the effect of statins on dementia outcomes. Cox PR models are defined, in general terms, as:

\[h(t) = h_o(t) \times exp(b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... +b_px_p)\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(t\) is the survival time;
\item
  \(h(t)\) is the hazard function; and
\item
  \(x_1,x_2,...,x_p\) are the covariates which determine the hazard function, while \(b_1,b_2,...,b_p\) are the coefficients for each covariate.
\item
  \(h_o(t)\) is the baseline hazard - when all \(x_i\) are zero, the \(exp()\) function resolves to 1.
\end{itemize}

As the values of \(b_i\) increases, value of \(exp(b_i)\) (i.e.~the hazard ratio) increases in tandem, thus reducing the survival time, \(t\).

A Cox PR model was chosen for this analysis as it inherently accounts for the length of time participants spend in each exposure group. Using this approach, time-at-risk can be properly attributed, thus mitigating the impact of immortal time bias. This is discussed in detail in the following section.

~

\hypertarget{cprd-immortal-time-bias}{%
\subsection{Immortal time bias and time-varying treatment indicators}\label{cprd-immortal-time-bias}}

Immortal time bias covers two distinct but related types of bias. The first presentation, the selection bias aspect (Panel A, Figure \ref{fig:immortalTimeBias}), occurs when time prior to the exposure is excluded leading to the exposed and control groups being followed up from different time points.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-levesque2010a}{179}} For example, if the unexposed group are followed from a cholesterol test result, while the exposed group is followed from date of LRA prescription, any events that occur in the exposed group prior to the exposure event will be inappropriately excluded from the analysis.

The second presentation of immortal time bias is as a type of misclassification bias (Panel B, Figure \ref{fig:immortalTimeBias}). It occurs when the exposure time prior to the exposure date, and any events occurring within it, is inappropriately assigned to the exposed group. This second presentation appears to be common in the existing literature, as several of the studies included in the systematic review presented in Chapter \ref{sys-rev-heading} were identified as being at risk of immortal time bias following formal risk of bias assessment using the ROBINS-I tool (see Section \ref{risk-of-bias-subheading}).

This analysis is primarily concerned with the second presentation of immortal time bias, as all participants were followed from a common index date (earliest of: date of raised cholesterol test results; hypercholesterolemeia diagnosis; or LRA prescription). To address the potential for this second form of immortal time bias in the analysis, I employed a time-varying indicator of treatment status to correctly allocate time-at-risk to the exposed and unexposed groups.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-levesque2010}{180}}

Under this approach, all patients start in the unexposed group, \& contribute time-at-risk until they are prescribed a lipid regulating agent and move into the exposed group. Note, patients for whom prescription of a lipid regulating agent was the index event only contribute time to the exposed group (i.e.~they enter the cohort and move into the exposed group on the same day).

\hypertarget{time-axis}{%
\subsection{Time axis}\label{time-axis}}

As part of a Cox proportional hazard model, there is the option to use either absolute time in cohort or participants age as the time scale of interest.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-lamarca1998}{181}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-pencina2007}{183}} A model using age as the time axis inherently accounts, or adjusts, for participants age as a potential confounded of the exposure-outcome relationship. The main analyses presented all used age as the time axis.

~

\hypertarget{sensitivity-analyses}{%
\subsection{Sensitivity analyses}\label{sensitivity-analyses}}

The primary analysis examined the effect of a lipid regulating agent on dementia risk, stratified by outcome and drug class. To assess the robustness of the results, a number of sensitivity analyses were performed. These are described in the following sections.

\hypertarget{control-outcomes}{%
\subsubsection{Control outcomes}\label{control-outcomes}}

In addition to the primary outcomes of interest (described in Section \ref{cprd-outcomes}), I extracted data on two additional control outcomes. The inclusion of control outcomes in observational analyses are a useful technique to assess the strength of uncontrolled confounding,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-lipsitch2010}{184}} and these outcomes are usually class as either ``negative'' or ``positive'' outcomes. Negative outcomes are those without a likely causal path between the exposure and outcome (see Figure \ref{fig:negativeOutcome} for a directed acyclic graph describing an ideal negative outcome).

Conversely, positive control outcomes are those with a known causal association with the exposure of interest, ideally sourced from large well conducted randomised controlled trials. Positive control outcomes are useful in observational epidemiology, as if the analysis can reproduce a known result for the control outcome, confidence in the result for the outcome of interest is increased.

Due to the wealth of data available on statins as a lipid regulating agent, control outcomes were chosen in reference to this drug class. Muscular backpain was chosen as a negative control outcome in this analysis. Despite observational analyses suggesting a link between statins and muscle pain (as opposed to more serious complications such as myopathy),\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-selva-ocallaghan2018}{185}} systematic reviews of the adverse events of statin use\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-collins2016a}{186}} and N-of-1 trials explicitly exploring the effect of statin use on muscle pain\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-herrett2021}{187}} have found no evidence of an effect. As such, if no evidence of an effect of statins on backpain is found in the analysis, then confidence in the results for the dementia outcomes is increased.

Additionally, incident ischemic heart disease was included as a positive control outcome, given the well-established protective effect of lipid-lowering treatment, via statins, on the risk of this condition.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-collins2016a}{186}} Similar to the backpain outcome, if the analysis strategy can reproduce this known protective association, this will provide evidence that potential confounders have been sufficiently adjusted for.

\hypertarget{sensitivity-cohorts}{%
\subsubsection{Sensitivity cohorts}\label{sensitivity-cohorts}}

Two sensitivity cohorts were also created. The first stratified by year of entry into the cohort in an attempt to assess for time period effects. The second removed participants who may have been pregnant (coded as under 55 and female) to assess the robustness of the estimates, as statins are contraindicated in pregnancy, .\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-karalis2016}{188}}

\hypertarget{statin-properties}{%
\subsubsection{Statin properties}\label{statin-properties}}

As detailed in the introduction, the properties of statins may be important in their effect, based on the ability of lipophilic statins to cross the blood brain barrier (see Section \ref{hold} in the Introductory Chapter).

To explore whether any observed effect for the statin analysis varied by statin property, a sensitivity analysis was performed, stratifying by statin lipophilicity.

\hypertarget{impact-of-dementia-code-lists}{%
\subsubsection{Impact of dementia code lists}\label{impact-of-dementia-code-lists}}

As part of an exploratory analysis of the effect of the choice of code lists on the analysis, I created an alternative Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's dementia outcome using code lists from a previous study published in 2009 by Smeeth \emph{et al}.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-smeeth2009}{189}}

This previous study used a propensity matching approach to estimate the effect of statins on a range of outcomes, and a protective effect of statin use on all-cause dementia (HR: 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.69-0.96) and non-AD dementia (HR: 0.82, 95\% CI: 0.69-0.97), but no evidence of an effect on AD (HR: 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.49-1.35).

The code lists used were obtained through correspondence with the authors of that study, and are available for inspection (see Section \ref{cprd-data-avail}).

A substantial majority (98.1\%) of participants prescribed a lipid-regulating agent were prescribed a statin. I excluded the ``Ezetimibe and statins'' and ``Nicotinic acid groups'' classes from subsequent analysis based on the extremely small number of participants in these groups (N=127 \& N=168 respectively; see Table \ref{tab:cprdCharacteristics-table}). Note that the ``Ezetimibe and statins'' treatment group represent those prescribed a single treatment containing both ezetimibe and statins, rather than those where the two treatments were prescribed concurrently.

\textbf{Alzheimer's disease}

No evidence was found for an effect of lipid-regulating agents on probable (HR: 0.98, 95\%CI: 0.94-1.01) and possible (HR: 0.97, 95\%CI: 0.93-1.01) Alzheimer's disease when compared with no treatment, with the sole exception of fibrates on probable Alzheimer's disease (HR: 1.28, 95\%CI: 1.08-1.52).

~

\textbf{Non-Alzheimer's disease dementias}

In contrast to the findings for Alzheimer's disease outcomes, lipid-regulating agents were associated with an increased risk of a subsequent diagnosis of vascular dementia (HR: 1.81, 95\%CI: 1.73-1.89) or other dementia (HR: 1.19, 95\%CI: 1.15-1.24). Again this effect was driven mainly by the statin subgroup, but there was some evidence that ezetimibe was associated with an increased risk of vascular (HR: 2.33, 95\%CI: 1.11-4.89) and other (HR: 1.88, 95\%CI: 1.01-3.5) dementia.

~

\textbf{All-cause dementia}

For the composite all-cause dementia outcome, I found treatment with a lipid-regulating agent was associated with a slightly increased risk (HR: 1.17, 95\%CI: 1.14-1.19), but the magnitude of the association was not as extreme as that observed for the vascular dementia subgroup. There was also some evidence that fibrates were associated with increased risk of all-cause dementia (HR: 1.28, 95\%CI: 1.08-1.52).

In almost all cases, the use of imputed data resulted in a marginal attenuation of the effects observed when using a complete cases analysis. It should be noted that due to the large amount of missing data (e.g.~793,720 participants (46.8\%) were missing a baseline LDL cholesterol measure), the number of participants included in the complete case analysis was substantially smaller than that included when using imputed data. In this case, though the overall position of the effect estimates does not change substantially when using the imputed dataset, there is a noticeable gain in power.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sterne2009b}{190}}

Following the primary analysis, the fully adjusted model was used to estimate the effect of treatment with a statin on the two control outcomes of back pain (negative) and ischemic heart disease (positive). The results of this analysis are presented in Figure \ref{fig:controlOutcomeFig}.

For the negative control, there was some evidence that treatment with a statin was associated with an increased risk of back pain (HR: 1.04, 95\% CI: 1.03-1.05), suggesting there may be some residual confounding. However, statin prescription was also associated with a substantially increased risk of ischemic heart disease (HR: 1.63, 95\% CI: 1.60-1.65).

These models were used to estimate the impact of adjustment for additional covariates. Note that obtaining an completely unadjusted model is not possible, as age was used in the Cox model as the time scale.

Adjustment for additional covariates beyond age and sex had a limited impact on the observed effect estimates, with the exception of the Probable AD outcome. In this case, adjustment for the full set of covariates attenuated to the null the protective effect observed when adjusting only for age and sex.

On the assumption that this variation could be caused by changes in the frequency of codes used to define Probable AD in the cohort, I performed a \emph{post-hoc} investigation of the frequency of each diagnoses stratified by year of entry (Table \ref{tab:diagnosisType-table}). While the total frequency of any dementia outcome declines in more recent strata, likely due to the limited follow-up inherent to these groups, the decline in frequency is relatively constant across all dementia subtypes.

When stratifying by statin properties, hydrophilic statins were less harmful in the any, vascular and other dementia outcomes compared to lipophilic statins (Figure \ref{fig:statinTypeFig}). Additionally, in the AD outcomes, hydrophilic statins had a small protective effect, compared to the absence of evidence for an effect for lipophilic statins.

When using the Smeeth et al code lists to define dementia outcomes, effect estimates of HR: 1.19 (95\% CI: 1.07-1.32) and HR: 1.33 (95\% CI: 1.26-1.42) were obtained for the Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's dementia outcomes respectively.

However, comparison of the results using the two sets of code lists was deemed less useful following a comparison of the codes used. While all of the codes used to define Alzheimer's in the Smeeth paper are included in the Probable Alzheimer's code-list (see Figure \ref{fig:smeethComparison}), I included several additional codes used to define this outcome (including, for example, ``Eu00013: {[}X{]}AD disease type 2''). Additionally, several of the codes used to define ``Possible Alzheimer's'' in this analysis are included in the ``Other dementia'' code list used by Smeeth.

\subsection{Summary of findings}\label{summary-of-findings}}

Lipid-regulating agents showed no evidence of an effect on probable and possible Alzheimer's disease when compared with no treatment, but were associated with increased risk of an all-cause dementia, vascular dementia and other dementia diagnosis. The effect observed in each case was driven by the statin subgroup, which included a substantial majority of participants. For the other drug classes, no association was found with any outcome, with two exceptions being that ezetimibe was associated with increased risk of vascular and other dementia, while fibrates were associated with increase risk of all-cause dementia and probable Alzheimer's disease.

The effect estimates were robust to the exclusion of potentially pregnant participants, and for all outcomes except Probable AD, no variation across grouped year of entry was observed. When looking at the statin subgroup alone, statin properties appeared to have a modifying effect, with hydrophilic statins being less harmful in the any, vascular and other dementia outcomes compared to lipophilic statins.

\hypertarget{interpretation-of-results}{%
\subsection{Interpretation of results}\label{interpretation-of-results}}

This section will expand on a potential explanation for the observed results detailed above. However, as the comparison of evidence across different sources is the aim of the triangulation exercise presented in later chapters, the section will not provide a detailed comparison with other published literature, except where needed to illustrate a methodological point. For a comparison of the result presented above with those from the systematic review (Chapter \ref{hold}) and the individual patient data analysis (Chapter \ref{hold}), see Section \ref{hold}.

A likely explanation for the observed increased risk of vascular and other dementia with lipid regulating agent use is residual confounding by indication. While the term has been used to describe different source of bias in epidemiological analyses,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-salas1999}{191}} ``confounding by indication'' is used here to described the role of risk factors that both prompt treatment (in this case statins) and increase the risk of the outcome (in this case vascular dementia), thus causing a distorted positive association between the treatment and outcome (see Figure \ref{fig:indicationBias}). In causal inference language, statins and dementia are said to be d-connected as there is an open ``backdoor'' path between them via the uncontrolled confounders.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-suttorp2015}{192}}





\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/cprd-analysis/indicationBias} \caption[Confounding by indication causal diagram]{Causal diagram (directed acyclic graph) illustrating confounding by indication.}\label{fig:indicationBias}
\end{figure}

In the case of this analysis, the confounding variable (or, more likely, variables) would prompt prescription of statins (or another lipid regulating agent) but also represent a vascular risk factor that contributes to the development of the vascular dementia.

Supporting evidence for this interpretation comes from a variety of sources, including the results of the control outcome analyses. The slight harmful effect for the backpain outcome is substantially smaller that that observed for the ischemic heart disease outcome, indicating that the majority of the uncontrolled confounding is likely related to vascular factors. This is supported by the increasingly harmful effect moving from Probable/Possible AD to other dementia to vascular dementia, indicating that the confounding by indication likely increases as the proportion of vascular outcomes increase. This is supported by the decision tree for assigning outcomes in the presence of greater than one dementia code, where the Alzheimer's disease outcomes require a ``pure'' condition, and the presence of any vascular or other dementia codes excludes participants from this group (Figure \ref{fig:decisionTreeFig}).

A review of other available literature suggests that this observation (a harmful effect of lipid regulating agents on vascular-related outcome) is not unusual. Using a conventional epidemiological technique, a previous analysis also found an increased risk of coronary heart disease (analogous to ischemic heart disease) in those taking statins (HR: 1.31, 95\% CI: 1.04-1.66).\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-danaei2013b}{193}} Following control for confounding by indication through use of a trial emulation analysis, the expected protective effect of statins was observed.

Conditioning entry into the study on being either ``at-risk'' or already diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia was employed in a pre-emptive attempt to mitigate confounding by indication, but evidence from the control outcomes suggests this was unsuccessful. I also adjusted for several additional potential baseline variables. However, important confounding variables for which I have not adjusted could include genetic factors. A recent preprint of a study in the UK Biobank demonstrated that an Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk score was associated with an increased risk of vascular dementia, and also with an increased frequency of self-reported raised cholesterol levels, a diagnosis of hypercholesterolaemia, and a history of taking lipid-regulating agents such as statins or ezetimibe.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-korologou-linden2020}{194}}

On a more general note, the unexpected increase in vascular dementia risk with statin use is particularly interesting given the absence of vascular dementia in the published literature, as highlighted in the previous chapter (see Section \ref{sys-rev-pub-bias}). It is possible that previous research identified a similar effect to this analysis, and via a publication bias mechanism, these results did not make it into the evidence base.

In summary, despite best efforts to account for strong confounding, participants prescribed a lipid regulating agent likely have a different vascular risk profile that those who are not, which may induce a spurious harmful association between lipid regulating agent use and vascular dementia outcomes.

~

\hypertarget{strengths-and-limitations}{%
\subsection{Strengths and limitations}\label{strengths-and-limitations}}

The primary strength of this analysis compared to others available in the literature is the relative size of the CPRD and length of follow-up. Having reviewed the other studies identified by the systematic review in Chapter \ref{sys-rev-heading}, this analysis of 1,684,564 participants is one of the largest available studies of this research question. Additionally, this analysis followed LRA users and non-users from a common index date, using a time-updating treatment indicator to correctly assign time-at-risk to the exposed and unexposed groups. This approach has been less commonly used in the literature and allows for the mitigation of potential immortal time bias.

However, the findings of this analysis are subject to several limitations. There is a strong possibility of differential misclassification\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-porta2014dictionary}{195}} of dementia-related conditions based on the exposure. As an illustrative example, those with memory complaints may be more likely to be classified as vascular dementia than Alzheimer's disease if their medical records contains prescriptions for lipid-regulating agents. Further, there is a potential for general non-differential misclassification of the outcome based on varying positive predictive value of electronic health record code lists to identify dementia cases.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-wilkinson2018}{196},\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcguinness2019b}{197}}

Misclassification of outcomes is not the only issue introduced by the use of EHR codes to define outcomes. Comparing and contrasting between different studies is particularly difficult because of the impact that the use of different code list can have on the analysis. This is a particular challenge in comparing research across different time-periods and coding systems, as illustrated by the discrepancy between the results when using the codes lists defined for this study and those used by Smeeth \emph{et al}.

\hypertarget{cprd-data-avail}{%
\subsection{Enabling easy synthesis of this analysis}\label{cprd-data-avail}}

In light of my own experiences in attempting to extract information for papers assessing preventative treatments, as documented in Section \ref{sys-rev-open-data}, the outputs from this analysis are readily available.

All code, Read codelists and summary statistics (i.e.~the tables presented in this chapter, plus summary tables of effect estimates) are readily available in machine readable formats (i.e.~as comma separated values, or CSV, files) from the archived repository for this project (Zotero DOI: XXXX-XXXX).

The raw data supporting this analysis is not available, as access to the CPRD data is controlled by a data monitoring committee. In the context of access-controlled data, sharing the analysis code represents a way for readers to validate the findings.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-goldacre2019c}{198}}

Additionally, to help ensure accurate reporting of this analysis, the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guidelines were used\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-vandenbroucke2007}{199}} (see Appendix \ref{hold} for the STROBE checklist).

This open approach will enable easy inclusion of this analysis in future evidence synthesis exercises, allowing new work to readily build on that presented here.

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

This chapter has provided new evidence on the potential repurposing of lipid-regulating agents for the prevention of all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and other dementia. It made use of a large scale electronic health record database, the CPRD, and employed a time-varying Cox proportional hazards model to account for the potential immortal time bias.

It found no evidence for an effect of lipid-regulating agents on probable or possible Alzheimer's disease. However, lipid regulating agent use was associated with an increased risk of all-cause, vascular and other dementias. In all cases, the estimated associations were driven by those observed in the statin subgroup, which comprised the majority of exposed participants in this cohort.

This chapter attempted to account for important sources of bias and provide a comparison with other available literature, as identified in the systematic review presented in Chapter \ref{sys-rev-heading}. However, there is a strong potential for uncontrolled confounding by indication and differential misclassification of the outcome on the basis of exposure, which raises questions about the findings, in particular the unexpected increase in risk of vascular dementia associated with statin use. This is supported by our findings for the negative and positive control outcomes used, which provide some evidence of uncontrolled vascular confounders that may both prompt LRA prescription and increase risk of vascular dementia. Future research using large scale electronic health records should aim to address these limitations, potentially by using a analytical design that more closely emulates a trial.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-danaei2013b}{193}}

Regardless, this analysis has provided an additional source of evidence for the triangulation exercise presented in Chapter \ref{discussion-heading}. In the following Chapter, the dataset described here is incorporated along with several other datasets as part of an IPD analysis to investigate the effect of blood lipid levels on dementia outcomes directly, rather than via the proxy of treatment.

Containerisation was used to ensure that the code is reproducible, in line iwht best practices

Commentary on the fact that the best you can do is replicate vs reproducible (due the closed nature of the data).

One is the ability to recreate the results given the same data and code, the other is the ability to recreate the results given the same code but a different dataset. IN theory it is possible to gain access the dataset given the information presented in Chapter @(ref:cprd-analysis-heading). However, access is dependency on an ISAC application to the managing body of the CPRD.

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction-2}}

Risk of bias assessment - evaluation of the internal validity of studies included in a systematic review - often forms a key part of the evidence synthesis process, particularly in the health sciences.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-cochranechpt7}{223}} A well-developed family of tools is widely used, which have in common the characteristic that they evaluate specific domains of bias rather being constructed as a checklist or a quantitative score.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-cochranechpt7}{223}} These tools include the RoB 2 tool for randomized trials,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sterne2019rob}{224}} the ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies of interventions,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sterne2016robins}{225}} the QUADAS 2 tool for test accuracy and the ROBIS tool for systematic reviews.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-whiting2011quadas}{226}} Within each bias domains a judgement is reached about the strength of the study in that regard: for example, the first domain in the Cochrane RoB 2 tool deals with bias arising from the randomization process.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-sterne2019rob}{224}} Accessible graphics summarizing the results of these domain-based risk-of-bias assessments are included in reports of systematic reviews. A convenient plot in many reviews is a ``traffic light'' plot, which tabulates the judgement for each study in each domain. For larger numbers of studies, when such a table become unmanageable, a popular alternative is a weighted bar plot, which show the proportion of information with each judgement for each domain.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-higgins2008assessing}{227}}

Researchers can face a number of barriers in creating these plots. While some evidence synthesis platforms, such as Cochrane's Review Manager,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-cochrane2014review}{228}} are able to produce these visualizations, not all researchers use these systems to conduct their systematic reviews, and copying the risk-of-bias data into these systems simply to produce the plots is inefficient and error prone. Likewise, creating the figures by hand, through software such as MS PowerPoint or Adobe Illustrator, may lead to unintentional errors and require the plots to be redrawn during an update to the review. Additionally, while the field of evidence synthesis software has grown rapidly in recent years,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-marshall2015systematic}{229}} this growth has not been equally distributed across the different aspects of the systematic review process. For example, a recent review found several software offerings aimed specifically at the abstract screening stage of the review process,\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-harrison2020software}{230}} but no similar time- and error-reducing tool has been proposed for visualizing the results of risk-of-bias assessments.

Fortunately, tools such as R, RStudio and \texttt{Shiny} (an R package for building interactive web apps) have made it easier than ever to produce such a tool.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-rref}{231}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-shinyref}{233}} Here, we present \texttt{robvis} (Risk Of Bias VISualiation),\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mcguinness2019a}{234}} an R package and \texttt{Shiny} web-app that allows users to create publication-ready risk-of-bias plots quickly and easily. Originally created for use with the major risk-of-bias assessment tools used in health research, the tool allows users to visualize the results from any domain-based risk-of-bias assessment or quality appraisal tool.

The tool is open-source and available to use free of charge. Users can download a stable version of the R package from CRAN (\url{https://cran.r-project.org/package=robvis}); or access and contribute to the development version via GitHub (\url{https://github.com/mcguinlu/robvis}).

\hypertarget{development-1}{%
\subsection{Development}\label{development-1}}

Development of \texttt{robvis} began in April 2019 at the Evidence Synthesis Hackathon (ESH), an event which brings together interested researchers, practitioners and coders to discuss and develop new open-source evidence synthesis technologies. Test versions of both the R package and the web app were made available in early June 2019, with attendees of the ESH and members of the Bristol Appraisal and Review of Research (BARR) group at the University of Bristol being invited to test the tool and provide feedback. This feedback, along with other feature suggestions from the wider evidence synthesis community captured via GitHub issues, was incorporated and the first release version of the package was uploaded to CRAN in November 2019. The tool has been well received and is beginning to be cited in the evidence synthesis literature.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-gibb2019consistent}{235}--\protect\hyperlink{ref-tanneru2020}{239}}

\hypertarget{installation-1}{%
\subsection{Installation}\label{installation-1}}

A stable version of \texttt{robvis} is hosted on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and can be installed using:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"robvis"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As development of \texttt{robvis} is ongoing, new features are often available in the development version some time before they appear in the stable CRAN version. The most recent development version can be install from GitHub using:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{devtools}\SpecialCharTok{::}\FunctionTok{install\_github}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"mcguinlu/robvis"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\hypertarget{usage-1}{%
\subsection{Usage}\label{usage-1}}

\texttt{robvis} contains two main functions. The first, \texttt{rob\_traffic\_light()}, creates a traffic light plot by tabulating each study by each domain, providing a more detailed view of the results of the risk-of-bias assessment. The second, \texttt{rob\_summary()}, creates a weighted bar plot showing the proportion of information with each judgement for each domain in the assessment tool specified.

A worked example using these functions is outlined below, showing the ease with which risk-of-bias plots can be created using \texttt{robvis}. A detailed description of the additional options that can be used with each function is presented in Table \ref{tab:robvisarguments}

Using the example data set (\texttt{data\_rob2}) which is built into the package and is presented in Table \ref{tab:robdata} for reference, the traffic light plot shown in Figure \ref{fig:trafficplot} is created using:

\textbf{NEED TO ADD DATA HERE!}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rob\_traffic\_light}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ data\_rob2,}
                  \AttributeTok{tool =} \StringTok{"ROB2"}\NormalTok{,}
                  \AttributeTok{psize =} \DecValTok{15}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/sys-rev-tools/example-rob-traffic-light-plot} \caption{Example risk of bias traffic light plot created using `robvis`}\label{fig:trafficplot}
\end{figure}

Similary, using the same data set, the summary barplot shown in Figure \ref{fig:summaryplot} is created using:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{rob\_summary}\NormalTok{(}\AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ data\_rob2,}
            \AttributeTok{tool =} \StringTok{"ROB2"}\NormalTok{, }
            \AttributeTok{overall =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figures/sys-rev-tools/example-rob-summary-barplot} \caption{Example risk of bias summary plot created using `robvis` and the example ROB2 dataset}\label{fig:summaryplot}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Reception and Future Plans}\label{reception-and-future-plans-1}}

As of December 2021, \texttt{robvis} has been downloaded more than 12400 times. It has been well received but the systematic review community, and has been cited frequently in the published literature. A paper describing the tool was published in a special issue of Research Synthesis Methods focusing on data visualisation methods. A chapter on the tool has been incorporated in to the ``Doing Meta-Analysis in R'' online textbook.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-mathias_harrer_2019_2551803}{240}}

While \texttt{robvis} is a stable package, a range of additional functionality could be added. At present, the number of tools with a specific template included in \texttt{robvis} is limited - adding additional templates is a priority. For example, a template for ROBIS, a tool for assessing risk of bias in systematic reviews, is in developement.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-whiting2016robis}{241}} Additionally, the tool does not yet allow for the production of paired forest plots, where the risk-of-bias judgement is presented alongside each specific result included in the meta-analysis.\textsuperscript{\protect\hyperlink{ref-cochranechpt7}{223}} This was initially considered to be beyond the scope of the tool, as it involves the visualization of something other than risk-of-bias assessments. However, following user-driven demand, this functionality is in development and will be available in the near future. Finally, we would like to add similar functionality to that provided by the \texttt{metafor::reporter()} function, which generates a brief paragraph of text describing the results of a meta-analysis. The future \texttt{robvis::reporter()} function would provide a boilerplate description of the assessment tool used and the key domains at risk of bias.
