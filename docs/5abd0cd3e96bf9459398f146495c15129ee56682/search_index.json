The template is built using Yihui Xie’s bookdown package, with heavy inspiration from Chester Ismay’s thesisdown and the OxThesis template (most recently adapted by John McManigle). This template’s sample content include illustrations of how to write a thesis in R Markdown, and largely follows the structure from this R Markdown workshop. Congratulations for taking a step further into the lands of open, reproducible science by writing your thesis using a tool that allows you to transparently include tables and dynamically generated plots directly from the underlying data. Hip hooray! Introduction Welcome to my thesis! "],
