  abstract = {Preprints have arrived. In increasing numbers, researchers across the life sciences are embracing the once-niche practice, shaking off decades of reluctance and posting hundreds of papers per week to preprint servers, sharing their findings with the community before embarking on the weary march through peer review. However, there are limited methods for individuals sifting through this avalanche of research to identify the preprints that are most relevant to their interests. Here, we describe Rxivist.org, a website that indexes all preprints posted to bioRxiv.org, the largest preprint server in the life sciences, and allows users to filter and sort papers based on download metrics and Twitter activity over a variety of categories and time periods. In this work, we hope to make it easier for readers to find relevant research on bioRxiv and to improve the visibility of preprints currently being read and discussed online.},

Here, we report how we collected and analyzed data on all 37,648 preprints uploaded to bioRxiv.org, the largest biology-focused preprint server, in its first five years. The rate of preprint uploads to bioRxiv continues to grow (exceeding 2,100 in October 2018), as does the number of downloads (1.1 million in October 2018). We also find that two-thirds of preprints posted before 2017 were later published in peer-reviewed journals, and find a relationship between the number of downloads a preprint has received and the impact factor of the journal in which it is published. We also describe Rxivist.org, a web application that provides multiple ways to interact with preprint metadata.},

  abstract = {Objectives Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses often analyze their IPD as if coming from a single study. We compare this approach with analyses that rather account for clustering of patients within studies. Study Design and Setting Comparison of effect estimates from logistic regression models in real and simulated examples. Results The estimated prognostic effect of age in patients with traumatic brain injury is similar, regardless of whether clustering is accounted for. However, a family history of thrombophilia is found to be a diagnostic marker of deep vein thrombosis [odds ratio, 1.30; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.70; P~=~0.05] when clustering is accounted for but not when it is ignored (odds ratio, 1.06; 95\% CI: 0.83, 1.37; P~=~0.64). Similarly, the treatment effect of nicotine gum on smoking cessation is severely attenuated when clustering is ignored (odds ratio, 1.40; 95\% CI: 1.02, 1.92) rather than accounted for (odds ratio, 1.80; 95\% CI: 1.29, 2.52). Simulations show models accounting for clustering perform consistently well, but downwardly biased effect estimates and low coverage can occur when ignoring clustering. Conclusion Researchers must routinely account for clustering in IPD meta-analyses; otherwise, misleading effect estimates and conclusions may arise.},

  abstract = {Objective To examine the potential for publication bias, data availability bias, and reviewer selection bias in recently published meta-analyses that use individual participant data and to investigate whether authors of such meta-analyses seemed aware of these issues. Design In a database of 383 meta-analyses of individual participant data that were published between 1991 and March 2009, we surveyed the 31 most recent meta-analyses of randomised trials that examined whether an intervention was effective. Identification of relevant articles and data extraction was undertaken by one author and checked by another. Results Only nine (29\%) of the 31 meta-analyses included individual participant data from ``grey literature'' (such as unpublished studies) in their primary meta-analysis, and the potential for publication bias was discussed or investigated in just 10 (32\%). Sixteen (52\%) of the 31 meta-analyses did not obtain all the individual participant data requested, yet five of these (31\%) did not mention this as a potential limitation, and only six (38\%) examined how trials without individual participant data might affect the conclusions. In nine (29\%) of the meta-analyses reviewer selection bias was a potential issue, as the identification of relevant trials was either not stated or based on a more selective, non-systematic approach. Investigation of four meta-analyses containing data from {$\geq$}10 trials revealed one with an asymmetric funnel plot consistent with publication bias, and the inclusion of studies without individual participant data revealed additional heterogeneity between trials. Conclusions Publication, availability, and selection biases are a potential concern for meta-analyses of individual participant data, but many reviewers neglect to examine or discuss them. These issues warn against uncritically viewing any meta-analysis that uses individual participant data as the most reliable. Reviewers should seek individual participant data from all studies identified by a systematic review; include, where possible, aggregate data from any studies lacking individual participant data to consider their potential impact; and investigate funnel plot asymmetry in line with recent guidelines.},

  abstract = {Blinding, random sequence generation, and allocation concealment are established strategies to minimize bias in RCTs. Meta-epidemiological studies of drug trials have demonstrated exaggerated treatment effects in RCTs where such methods were not employed. As blinding is more difficult in surgical trials it is important to determine whether this applies to them. The study aimed to investigate this using systematic meta-epidemiological methods.The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched for systematic reviews of RCTs that compared laparoscopic and open abdominal surgical procedures. Each review was then scrutinized to determine whether at least one of the included trials was blinded. Eligible reviews were updated and individual RCTs retrieved. Extracted data included the primary outcomes of interest (length of stay and complications), secondary outcomes and a risk of bias assessment. A multistep meta-regression analysis was then performed to obtain an overall difference in the reported outcome differences between trials that employed each bias-minimization strategy, and those that did not.Some 316 RCTs were included, reporting on eight different procedures. Patient-blinded RCTs reported a smaller difference in length of stay between laparoscopic and open groups (difference of standardized mean differences \textendash 0{$\cdot$}36 (95 per cent c.i. \textendash 0{$\cdot$}73 to 0{$\cdot$}00)) and complications (ratio of odds ratios 0{$\cdot$}76 (95 per cent c.i. 0{$\cdot$}61 to 0{$\cdot$}93)). Blinding of postoperative carers and outcome assessors had similar effects.Lack of blinding significantly altered the treatment effect estimates of RCTs comparing laparoscopic and open surgery. Blinding should be implemented in surgical RCTs where possible to avoid systematic bias.},

Cognitive performance (global cognitive functioning, visual memory, verbal fluency, psychomotor speed and executive function), clinical diagnosis of dementia, and fibrate and statin use, were evaluated at baseline, and 2, 4, and 7 year follow-up. Multivariate Cox models were stratified by gender and adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, mental and physical health including vascular risk factors, and genetic vulnerability (apolipoprotein E and cholesteryl ester transfer protein). For women but not men, fibrate use was specifically associated with an increased risk over 7 years of decline in visual memory only (HR=1.29, 95\%CI=1.09\textendash 1.54, p=0.004), and did not increase risk for incident dementia. This association was independent of genetic vulnerability related to ApoE and Cholesteryl Exchange Transfer Protein polymorphisms and occurred only in women with higher LDL-cholesterol levels and treated with fibrate (HR=1.39, 95\%CI=1.08\textendash 1.79, p=0.01) and not in those with lower LDL-cholesterol levels irrespective of fibrate treatment. For both sexes, no significant associations were found between statins (irrespective of their lipophilicity) and either cognitive decline or dementia incidence. This prospective study, adjusting for multiple confounders, found no evidence that LLA given in late life reduced the risk of cognitive decline and dementia, but did raise the possibility that women with treatment-resistant high LDL-cholesterol may be at increased risk of decline in visual memory.},

Objective: To evaluate the quantity, quality, and representativeness of evidence, we conducted a review of reviews of risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), Vascular dementia (VaD), and Any Dementia. Methods: PubMed, Cochrane library, and the Global Index Medicus were searched to identify meta-analyses of observational studies of risk factors for AD, VaD, and Any Dementia. PROSPERO CRD42017053920. Results: Meta-analysis data were available for 34 risk factors for AD, 26 risk factors for Any Dementia and eight for VaD. Quality of evidence varied greatly in terms of the number of contributing studies, whether data on midlife exposure was available, and consistency of measures. The most evidence was available for cardiovascular risk factors. The most geographically representative evidence (five of six global regions) was available for alcohol, physical activity, diabetes, high midlife BMI, antihypertensives, and motor function. Evidence from Australia/Oceana or Africa was limited. With the exception of diabetes, meta-analysis data were unavailable from Latin America/Caribbean. Midlife specific data were only available for cholesterol and arthritis. Conclusion: There is a lack of midlife specific data, limited data on VaD, and a lack of geographical representation for many risk factors for dementia. The quality, quantity, and representativeness of evidence needs to be considered before recommendations are made about the relevance of risk factors in mid- or late-life or for dementia subtypes.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses of clinical trials with continuous outcome data typically report the effect of an intervention as either a mean difference or a standardized mean difference. These results can be difficult to interpret, and re-expressing the effect size in terms of risk may facilitate understanding and applicability. We describe three methods for obtaining risks in such situations. Two of these methods involve direct transformation of a standardized mean difference to an odds ratio. The third entails estimation of risks in the two groups for a specific cut point. We extend this third approach to a completed meta-analysis by expressing the finding in the format of a single `meta-study'. We compare the methods in two examples of meta-analyses and in a series of simulation studies that examine their properties in individual studies and in meta-analyses. These simulations show that the methods for expressing meta-analysis results from continuous outcomes are sensitive to underlying distributions, sample sizes and cut points but are remarkably robust to the presence of heterogeneity across studies. We offer suggestions of situations in which the various methods may safely be applied. In particular, if the underlying distribution is approximately normal, then estimation of risks for a specific cut point may be used for large sample sizes; direct transformations may be preferable otherwise. However, if the standard deviations in the two groups are notably different, then none of the methods have good properties. Furthermore, absolute risks are safely estimated after direct transformation only if they are in the region of 20\% to 80\%. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Sex differences in morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease have been recognized by the medical community for decades. Investigation into the underlying biological basis of these differences was largely neglected by the scientific community until a report released by the Institute of Medicine in the United States in 2001 "Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health: Does Sex Matter?" Recommendations from this report included the need for more accurate use of the terms "sex" and "gender", better tools and resources to study the biological basis of sex differences, integration of findings from different levels of biological organization and continued synergy between basic and clinical researchers. Ten years after the Institute's report, this review evaluates some of the sex differences in cardiovascular disease, reviews new approaches to study sex differences and emphasizes areas where further research is required. In the era of personalized medicine, the study of the biological basis of sex differences promises to optimize preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular disease in men and women, but will require diligence by the scientific and medical communities to remember that sex does matter.},

  abstract = {Background Dementia includes a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive loss of cognitive function and a decrease in the ability to perform activities of daily living. Systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) focus on how well the index test detects patients with the disease in terms of figures such as sensitivity and specificity. Although DTA reviews about dementia are essential, at present there is no information about their quantity and quality. Methods We searched for DTA reviews in MEDLINE (1966\textendash 2013), EMBASE (1980\textendash 2013), The Cochrane Library (from its inception until December 2013) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the reviews using the AMSTAR measurement tool, and the quality of the reporting using the PRISMA checklist. We describe the main characteristics of these reviews, including basic characteristics, type of dementia, and diagnostic test evaluated, and we summarize the AMSTAR and PRISMA scores. Results We selected 24 DTA systematic reviews. Only 10 reviews (41.6\%), assessed the bias of included studies and few (33\%) used this information to report the review results or to develop their conclusions Only one review (4\%) reported all methodological items suggested by the PRISMA tool. Assessing methodology quality by means of the AMSTAR tool, we found that six DTA reviews (25\%) pooled primary data with the aid of methods that are used for intervention reviews, such as Mantel-Haenszel and separate random-effects models (25\%), while five reviews (20.8\%) assessed publication bias by means of funnel plots and/or Egger's Test. Conclusions Our assessment of these DTA reviews reveals that their quality, both in terms of methodology and reporting, is far from optimal. Assessing the quality of diagnostic evidence is fundamental to determining the validity of the operating characteristics of the index test and its usefulness in specific settings. The development of high quality DTA systematic reviews about dementia continues to be a challenge.

  abstract = {AIMS: With the increase in the number of systematic reviews available, a logical next step to provide decision makers in healthcare with the evidence they require has been the conduct of reviews of existing systematic reviews. Syntheses of existing systematic reviews are referred to by many different names, one of which is an umbrella review. An umbrella review allows the findings of reviews relevant to a review question to be compared and contrasted. An umbrella review's most characteristic feature is that this type of evidence synthesis only considers for inclusion the highest level of evidence, namely other systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A methodology working group was formed by the Joanna Briggs Institute to develop methodological guidance for the conduct of an umbrella review, including diverse types of evidence, both quantitative and qualitative. The aim of this study is to describe the development and guidance for the conduct of an umbrella review. METHODS: Discussion and testing of the elements of methods for the conduct of an umbrella review were held over a 6-month period by members of a methodology working group. The working group comprised six participants who corresponded via teleconference, e-mail and face-to-face meeting during this development period. In October 2013, the methodology was presented in a workshop at the Joanna Briggs Institute Convention. Workshop participants, review authors and methodologists provided further testing, critique and feedback on the proposed methodology. RESULTS: This study describes the methodology and methods developed for the conduct of an umbrella review that includes published systematic reviews and meta-analyses as the analytical unit of the review. Details are provided regarding the essential elements of an umbrella review, including presentation of the review question in a Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome format, nuances of the inclusion criteria and search strategy. A critical appraisal tool with 10 questions to help assess risk of bias in systematic reviews and meta-analyses was also developed and tested. Relevant details to extract from included reviews and how to best present the findings of both quantitative and qualitative systematic reviews in a reader friendly format are provided. CONCLUSIONS: Umbrella reviews provide a ready means for decision makers in healthcare to gain a clear understanding of a broad topic area. The umbrella review methodology described here is the first to consider reviews that report other than quantitative evidence derived from randomized controlled trials. The methodology includes an easy to use and informative summary of evidence table to readily provide decision makers with the available, highest level of evidence relevant to the question posed.},

We performed a genome-wide association study and analysis of known genetic risk loci for AD dementia using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. Neuropathologic data were used to define clinico-pathologic AD dementia or controls, assess core neuropathologic features of AD (neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs), and evaluate commonly co-morbid neuropathologic changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular brain injury (VBI). Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, NPs, NFTs, CAA, and LBD with a number of variants in and around the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). GalNAc transferase 7 (GALNT7), ATP-Binding Cassette, Sub-Family G (WHITE), Member 1 (ABCG1), and an intergenic region on chromosome 9 were associated with NP score; and Potassium Large Conductance Calcium-Activated Channel, Subfamily M, Beta Member 2 (KCNMB2) was strongly associated with HS.

  abstract = {Objective To test the hypothesis that low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol due to genetic variation in the genes responsible for LDL cholesterol metabolism and biosynthesis(PCSK9 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), respectively) is associated with a high risk of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, any dementia, and Parkinson's disease in the general population. Design Mendelian randomisation study. Setting Copenhagen General Population Study and Copenhagen City Heart Study. Participants 111 194 individuals from the Danish general population. Main outcome measures Risk of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, all dementia, and Parkinson's disease. Results In observational analyses, the multifactorially adjusted hazard ratio for Parkinson's disease in participants with an LDL cholesterol level {$<$}1.8 mmol/L versus {$\geq$}4.0 mmol/L was 1.70 (95\% confidence interval 1.03 to 2.79), whereas the corresponding hazard ratios for Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, or any dementia did not differ from 1.0. PCSK9 and HMGCR variants combined were associated with a 9.3\% lower LDL cholesterol level. In genetic, causal analyses adjusted for age, sex, and year of birth, the risk ratios for a lifelong 1 mmol/L lower LDL cholesterol level were 0.57 (0.27 to 1.17) for Alzheimer's disease, 0.81 (0.34 to 1.89) for vascular dementia, 0.66 (0.34 to 1.26) for any dementia, and 1.02 (0.26 to 4.00) for Parkinson's disease. Summary level data from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project using Egger Mendelian randomisation analysis gave a risk ratio for Alzheimer's disease of 0.24 (0.02 to 2.79) for 26 PCSK9 and HMGCR variants, and of 0.64 (0.52 to 0.79) for 380 variants of LDL cholesterol level lowering. Conclusion Low LDL cholesterol levels due to PCSK9 and HMGCR variants had no causal effect on high risk of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, any dementia, or Parkinson's disease; however, low LDL cholesterol levels may have a causal effect in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Previous reviews of associations of apolipoprotein E (apoE) genotype and coronary disease have been dominated by smaller studies that are liable to biases. OBJECTIVE: To reassess associations of apoE genotypes with circulating lipid levels and with coronary risk. DATA SOURCES: We conducted an updated meta-analysis including both published and previously unreported studies, using MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Science Citation Index, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure Database published between January 1970 and January 2007, reference lists of articles retrieved, and a registry of relevant studies. STUDY SELECTION: Eighty-two studies of lipid levels (86,067 healthy participants) and 121 studies of coronary outcomes (37,850 cases and 82,727 controls) were identified, with prespecified principal focus on studies with at least 1000 healthy participants for lipids and those with at least 500 coronary outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Information on genotype frequencies, lipid levels, coronary outcomes, and laboratory and population characteristics were recorded independently by 2 investigators and/or supplied by study investigators. RESULTS: In the most extreme comparison, people with the epsilon2/epsilon2 genotype had 1.14 mmol/L (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-1.40 mmol/L [44.0 mg/dL; 95\% CI; 33.6-51.1 mg/dL]) or about 31\% (95\% CI, 23\%-38\%) lower mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) values than those with the epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype. There were approximately linear relationships of apoE genotypes (when ordered epsilon2/epsilon2, epsilon2/epsilon3, epsilon2/epsilon4, epsilon3/epsilon3, epsilon3/epsilon4, epsilon4/epsilon4) with LDL-C and with coronary risk. The relationship with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was inverse and shallow and that with triglycerides was nonlinear and largely confined to the epsilon2/epsilon2 genotype. Compared with epsilon3/epsilon3, the odds ratio for coronary disease was 0.80 (95\% CI, 0.70-0.90) in epsilon2 carriers and was 1.06 (95\% CI, 0.99-1.13) in epsilon4 carriers. CONCLUSIONS: There are approximately linear relationships of apoE genotypes with both LDL-C levels and coronary risk. Compared with individuals with the epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype, epsilon2 carriers have a 20\% lower risk of coronary heart disease and epsilon4 carriers have a slightly higher risk.},

  abstract = {Background Lipid-lowering medications (LLMs) and especially statin drugs can delay cognitive decline and dementia onset in individuals with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline. Methods A longitudinal, observational study was conducted of 3069 cognitively healthy elderly patients ({$\geq$}75 years of age) who were enrolled in the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study. The primary outcome measure was the time to adjudicated all-cause dementia and Alzheimer dementia (AD). The secondary outcome measure was the change in global cognitive function over time measured by scores from the Modified Mini-Mental State Exam (3MSE) and the cognitive subscale of the AD Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog). Results Among participants without MCI at baseline, the current use of statins was consistently associated with a reduced risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 0.65-0.96; P = .021) and AD (HR, 0.57; 95\% CI, 0.39-0.85; P = .005). In participants who initiated statin therapy, lipophilic statins tended to reduce dementia risk more than nonlipophilic agents. In contrast, there was no significant association between LLM use (including statins), dementia onset, or cognitive decline in individuals with baseline MCI. However, in individuals without MCI at baseline, there was a trend for a neuroprotective effect of statins on cognitive decline. Conclusions Statins may slow the rate of cognitive decline and delay the onset of AD and all-cause dementia in cognitively healthy elderly individuals, whereas individuals with MCI may not have comparable cognitive protection from these agents. However, the results from this observational study need to be interpreted with caution and will require confirmation by randomized clinical trials stratifying treatment groups based on MCI status at baseline.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Background             In addition to motor deficits, Parkinson's disease (PD) may cause perceptual impairments. The role of perceptual impairments in sensorimotor function is unclear, and has typically been studied in single-joint motions. Research Question: We hypothesized that perception of whole-body motion is impaired in PD and contributes to balance impairments. We tested 1) whether directional acuity to whole body perturbations during standing was worse in people with PD compared to neurotypical older adults (NOA), and 2) whether balance ability, as assessed by the MiniBESTest, was associated with poor directional acuity in either group.                                   Methods             Participants were exposed to pairs of support-surface translation perturbations in a two-alternative forced choice testing paradigm developed previously in a young healthy population. The first perturbation of each pair was directly backward and the second deviated to the left or right (1\textdegree\textendash 44\textdegree ). Participants judged and reported whether the perturbations in each pair were in the ``same'' or ``different'' direction. This information was used to calculate directional acuity thresholds corresponding to ``just-noticeable differences'' in perturbation direction. Linear mixed models determined associations between directional thresholds and clinical variables including MDS UPDRS-III score, age, and MiniBESTest score. Results: 20 PD (64{$\pm$}7 y, 12 male, {$\geqslant$}12 hours since last intake of antiparkinsonian medications) and 12 NOA (64{$\pm$}8, 6 male) were assessed. Directional thresholds were higher (worse) among PD participants (17.6{$\pm$}5.9\textdegree{} vs. 12.8{$\pm$}3.3\textdegree, P{$<$}0.01). Linear mixed models further showed that higher thresholds were associated with MDS UPDRS-III score (P{$<$}0.01), and were associated with poorer balance ability among PD participants (P{$<$}0.01), but not among NOA participants (P=0.40). Significance: Perception of whole-body motion is impaired in PD and may contribute to impaired balance and falls.},

  abstract = {The risk of premature mortality caused by cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is approximately three times higher in the Central Eastern European region than in high income European countries, which suggests a lack and/or ineffectiveness of preventive interventions against CVDs. The aim of the present study was to provide data on the relationship between premature CVD mortality, statin utilization as a preventive medication and socioeconomic deprivation at the district level in Hungary. As a conceptually new approach, the prescription of statins, the prescription redemption and the ratio between redemption and prescription rates were also investigated. The number of prescriptions for statins and the number of redeemed statin prescriptions were obtained from the National Health Insurance Fund Administration of Hungary for each primary healthcare practice for the entire year of 2012. The data were aggregated at the district level. To define the frequency of prescription and of redemption, the denominator was the number of the 40+-year-old population adjusted by the rates of 60+-year-old population of the district. The standardized mortality rates, frequency of statin prescriptions, redeemed statin prescriptions, and ratios for compliance in relation to the national average were mapped using the ``disease mapping'' option, and their association with deprivation (tertile of deprivation index as a district-based categorical covariate) was defined using the risk analysis capabilities within the Rapid Inquiry Facility. The risk analysis showed a significant positive association between deprivation and the relative risk of premature cardiovascular mortality, and a reverse J-shaped association between the relative frequency of statin prescriptions and deprivation. Districts with the highest deprivation showed a low relative frequency of statin prescriptions; however, significantly higher primary compliance (redemption) was observed in districts with the highest deprivation. Our data clearly indicate that insufficient statin utilization is strongly linked to the so-called physician-factor, i.e., a statin prescription. Consequently, statin treatment is poor and represents a significant barrier to reducing mortality, particularly among people living in highly deprived areas of the country.},

  abstract = {Creating search strategies for systematic reviews, finding the best balance between sensitivity and specificity, and translating search strategies between databases is challenging. Several methods describe standards for systematic search strategies, but a consistent approach for creating an exhaustive search strategy has not yet been fully described in enough detail to be fully replicable. The authors have established a method that describes step by step the process of developing a systematic search strategy as needed in the systematic review. This method describes how single-line search strategies can be prepared in a text document by typing search syntax (such as field codes, parentheses, and Boolean operators) before copying and pasting search terms (keywords and free-text synonyms) that are found in the thesaurus. To help ensure term completeness, we developed a novel optimization technique that is mainly based on comparing the results retrieved by thesaurus terms with those retrieved by the free-text search words to identify potentially relevant candidate search terms. Macros in Microsoft Word have been developed to convert syntaxes between databases and interfaces almost automatically. This method helps information specialists in developing librarian-mediated searches for systematic reviews as well as medical and health care practitioners who are searching for evidence to answer clinical questions. The described method can be used to create complex and comprehensive search strategies for different databases and interfaces, such as those that are needed when searching for relevant references for systematic reviews, and will assist both information specialists and practitioners when they are searching the biomedical literature.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review Mendelian randomization (MR) is a technique for judging the causal impact of a risk factor on an outcome from observational data using genetic variants. Although evidence from Mendelian randomization for the effects of major lipids and lipoproteins on coronary heart disease (CHD) risk has been around for a relatively long time, new data resources and new methodological approaches have given fresh insight into these relationships. The lessons from these analyses are likely to be highly relevant when it comes to lipidomics and the analyses of lipid subspecies whose biology is less well understood. Recent findings Although analyses of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and lipoprotein(a) are unambiguous as there are genetic variants that associate exclusively with these risk factors and have well-understood biology, analyses for triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) are less clear. For example, a subset of genetic variants having specific associations with HDL-c are not associated with CHD risk, but an allele score including all variants associated with HDL-c does associate with CHD risk. Recently developed methods, such as multivariable MR, MR-Egger, and a weighted median method, suggest that the relationship between HDL-c and CHD risk is null, thus confirming experimental evidence. Summary Robust methods for MR have important utility for understanding the causal relationships between major lipids and CHD risk, and are likely to play an important role in judging the causal relevance of lipid subspecies and other metabolites measured on high-dimensional phenotyping platforms.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis using individual participant data (IPD) obtains and synthesises the raw, participant-level data from a set of relevant studies. The IPD approach is becoming an increasingly popular tool as an alternative to traditional aggregate data meta-analysis, especially as it avoids reliance on published results and provides an opportunity to investigate individual-level interactions, such as treatment-effect modifiers. There are two statistical approaches for conducting an IPD meta-analysis: one-stage and two-stage. The one-stage approach analyses the IPD from all studies simultaneously, for example, in a hierarchical regression model with random effects. The two-stage approach derives aggregate data (such as effect estimates) in each study separately and then combines these in a traditional meta-analysis model. There have been numerous comparisons of the one-stage and two-stage approaches via theoretical consideration, simulation and empirical examples, yet there remains confusion regarding when each approach should be adopted, and indeed why they may differ., In this tutorial paper, we outline the key statistical methods for one-stage and two-stage IPD meta-analyses, and provide 10 key reasons why they may produce different summary results. We explain that most differences arise because of different modelling assumptions, rather than the choice of one-stage or two-stage itself. We illustrate the concepts with recently published IPD meta-analyses, summarise key statistical software and provide recommendations for future IPD meta-analyses. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors.

Cholesterol and apolipoprotein E co-localized to the core of thioflavin S-positive (fibrillar) plaques, but not thioflavin S-negative (diffuse) plaques from an early age. By 18 months of age, there was extensive coverage of fibrillar plaques immunopositive for apolipoprotein E and cholesterol oxidase.

Alzheimer's disease is a specific disease entity and is the commonest cause of dementia. In this, the first of two articles, we will review the clinical and service implications of dementia syndrome; the second will concentrate on Alzheimer's disease. About 12 million people worldwide have dementia, and this total is likely to increase to 25 million by 2040.1 The Dementia UK report2 estimated that about 637\,000 people in the UK have dementia syndrome and the annual cost of their care is \textsterling 17bn (\texteuro 18.7bn; \$24.7bn), which is more than heart disease (\textsterling 4bn), stroke (\textsterling 3bn), and cancer (\textsterling 2bn). Annual costs per patient have been estimated at \$57\,000 in the United States and \$64\,000 in Italy (including estimates for informal care) and \$24\,000 in Sweden and \$14\,000 in Canada (excluding informal care).w1 Dementia is one of the main causes of disability in later life; in terms of global burden of disease, it contributes \ldots},

Methods               Using data from a prospective cohort study in the Netherlands, we conceptualized a sequence of ``trials'' in which eligible individuals ages 55\textendash 80 years were classified as statin initiators or noninitiators for every consecutive month between 1993 and 2007 and were followed until diagnosis of dementia, death, loss to follow-up, or the end of follow-up. We estimated 2 types of effects of statin use on dementia and a combined endpoint of dementia or death: the effect of initiation vs no initiation and the effect of sustained use vs no use. We estimated risk by statin treatment strategy over time via pooled logistic regression. We used inverse-probability weighting to account for treatment-confounder feedback in estimation of per-protocol effects.                                         Results               Of 233,526 eligible person-trials (6,373 individuals), there were 622 initiators and 232,904 noninitiators. Comparing statin initiation with no initiation, the 10-year risk differences (95\% confidence interval) were -0.1\% (-2.3\% to 1.8\%) for dementia and 0.3\% (-2.7\% to 3.3\%) for dementia or death. Comparing sustained statin use vs no use, the 10-year risk differences were -2.2\% (-5.2\% to 1.6\%) for dementia and -5.1\% (-10.5\% to -1.1\%) for dementia or death.                                         Conclusions               Individuals with sustained statin use, but not statin initiation alone, had reduced 10-year risks of dementia and dementia or death. Our results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of initiators and events and potential for residual confounding.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Pharmacoepidemiology researchers often utilize data from two UK electronic medical record databases, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and The Health Improvement Network (THIN), and may choose to combine the two in an effort to increase sample size. To minimize duplication of data, previous studies examined the practice-level overlap between these databases. However, the proportion of overlapping patients remains unknown. We developed a method using demographic and pharmacy variables to identify patients included in both CPRD and THIN, and applied this method to measure the proportion of overlapping patients who initiated the oral anti-diabetic drug saxagliptin. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study among patients initiating saxagliptin in CPRD and THIN between October 2009 and September 2012. Within both databases, we identified patients: (i) {$\geq$}18 years, (ii) newly prescribed saxagliptin, and (iii) with {$\geq$}180 days enrollment prior to saxagliptin initiation. Demographic data (birth year, sex, patient registration date, family number, and marital status) and prescriptions (including dates) for the first two oral anti-diabetic drugs prescribed within the study period were used to identify matching patients. RESULTS: Among 4202 CPRD and 3641 THIN patients initiating saxagliptin, 2574 overlapping patients (61\% of CPRD saxagliptin initiators; 71\% of THIN saxagliptin initiators) were identified. Among these patients, 2474 patients (96\%) perfectly matched on all demographic and prescription data. CONCLUSIONS: Within each database, over 60\% of patients initiating saxagliptin were included within both CPRD and THIN. Combined demographic and prescription data can be used to identify patients included in both CPRD and THIN.},

Mediation analysis experiences a number of methodological difficulties, including bias due to confounding and measurement error. Mendelian randomisation (MR) can be used to improve causal inference for mediation analysis. We describe two approaches that can be used for estimating mediation analysis with MR: multivariable Mendelian randomisation (MVMR) and two-step Mendelian randomisation. We outline the approaches and provide code to demonstrate how they can be used in mediation analysis. We review issues that can affect analyses, including confounding, measurement error, weak instrument bias, and analysis of multiple mediators. Description of the methods is supplemented by simulated and real data examples. Although Mendelian randomisation relies on large sample sizes and strong assumptions, such as having strong instruments and no horizontally pleiotropic pathways, our examples demonstrate that it is unlikely to be affected by confounders of the exposure or mediator and the outcome, reverse causality and non-differential measurement error of the exposure or mediator. Both MVMR and two-step MR can be implemented in both individual-level MR and summary data MR, and can improve causal inference in mediation analysis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), also known as neuropsychiatric symptoms, represent a heterogeneous group of non-cognitive symptoms and behaviors occurring in subjects with dementia. BPSD constitute a major component of the dementia syndrome irrespective of its subtype. They are as clinically relevant as cognitive symptoms as they strongly correlate with the degree of functional and cognitive impairment. BPSD include agitation, aberrant motor behavior, anxiety, elation, irritability, depression, apathy, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, and sleep or appetite changes. It is estimated that BPSD affect up to 90\% of all dementia subjects over the course of their illness, and is independently associated with poor outcomes, including distress among patients and caregivers, long-term hospitalization, misuse of medication, and increased health care costs. Although these symptoms can be present individually it is more common that various psychopathological features co-occur simultaneously in the same patient. Thus, categorization of BPSD in clusters taking into account their natural course, prognosis, and treatment response may be useful in the clinical practice. The pathogenesis of BPSD has not been clearly delineated but it is probably the result of a complex interplay of psychological, social, and biological factors. Recent studies have emphasized the role of neurochemical, neuropathological, and genetic factors underlying the clinical manifestations of BPSD. A high degree of clinical expertise is crucial to appropriately recognize and manage the neuropsychiatric symptoms in a patient with dementia. Combination of non-pharmacological and careful use of pharmacological interventions is the recommended therapeutic for managing BPSD. Given the modest efficacy of current strategies, there is an urgent need to identify novel pharmacological targets and develop new non-pharmacological approaches to improve the adverse outcomes associated with BPSD.},

In 1979, he wrote: "It is surely a great criticism of our profession that we have not organised a critical summary, by specialty or subspecialty, adapted periodically, of all relevant randomised controlled trials." The Cochrane Collaboration has evolved in response to this challenge and will eventually cover all areas of health care.

  abstract = {If smoking is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) but a smoker dies of another cause before developing or manifesting AD, smoking-related mortality may mask the relationship between smoking and AD. This phenomenon, referred to as competing risk, complicates efforts to model the effect of smoking on AD. Typical survival regression models assume that censorship from analysis is unrelated to an individual's probability of developing AD (i.e., that censoring is noninformative). However, if individuals who die before developing AD are younger than those who survive long enough to develop AD, and if they include a higher percentage of smokers than nonsmokers, the incidence of AD will appear to be higher in older individuals and in nonsmokers. Further, age-specific mortality rates are higher in smokers because they die earlier than nonsmokers. Therefore, if we fail to take into account the competing risk of death when we estimate the effect of smoking on AD, we bias the results and are really only comparing the incidence of AD in nonsmokers with that in the healthiest smokers. In this study, we demonstrate that the effect of smoking on AD differs in models that are and are not adjusted for competing risks.},

The recent American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines on lipid management emphasize treatment of individuals at increased risk for developing CVD events with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) at doses proven to reduce CVD events. However, there are limited options for patients who are either intolerant to statin therapy, develop CVD despite being on maximally tolerated statin therapy, or have severe hypercholesterolemia. Recently the Food and Drug Administration approved two novel medications for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol reduction: Evolocumab and Alirocumab. These agents target and inactivate proprotein convertase subtilsin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a hepatic protease that attaches and internalizes LDL receptors into lysosomes hence promoting their destruction. By preventing LDL receptor destruction, LDL-C levels can be lowered 50\%-60\% above that achieved by statin therapy alone. This review explores PCSK-9 biology and the mechanisms available to alter it; clinical trials targeting PCSK9 activity, and the current state of clinically available inhibitors of PCSK9.},

The purpose of this paper is to exemplify methods by which results expressed either as risks (or rates) according to quantile groups of the quantitative variable or as results derived from a logistic regression analysis can be reexpressed in a uniform manner, as a mean difference in the quantitative variable between the cases of disease and the other subjects in the study. An important assumption of the methods is that the quantitative variable has an approximately normal distribution, and a way of investigating the appropriateness of this assumption is given. The methods can be applied to both prospective and case-control studies and are exemplified by a number of studies of serum albumin concentrations and mortality. In some applications, these methods can be used as a precursor to formal meta-analysis, for example, when differential control of potential confounding factors is not a problem. At the least, the methods can be useful either in quantitatively reviewing published studies before undertaking new research or in putting the results of a new study into the context of previously published ones.

It is necessary to clarify the relationship between statin use and risk of incident dementia as well as whether class effects exist. Methods In this population-based retrospective cohort study, total 33,398 patients aged{$\geq$}60years were selected from a subset of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Databases and followed up for tracking the occurrence of any type of dementia from 2000 to 2010. The Cox proportional hazards models were used. Results Compared to nonusers, statin users had a significantly lower risk of incident dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.72\textendash 0.85, p{$<$}0.001). The potency and the cumulative duration of statin utilized were associated with the reducing risk of dementia. After stratifying by gender, the risk of incident dementia was lower in female statin users (HR, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.68\textendash 0.85, p{$<$}0.001) than in male statin users (HR, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.75\textendash 0.98, p=0.024). Higher potency and longer cumulative duration of statin use were required for reducing the risk of incident dementia in male patients than in female patients. Conclusion Statin use was associated with a significantly lower risk of dementia in the elderly patients in Taiwan. The potency and the cumulative duration of statin utilized played critical roles.},

Major electronic databases were searched until December 27th, 2017 for studies investigating use of statins and incident cognitive decline in adults. Random-effects meta-analyses calculating relative risks (RRs) were conducted to synthesize effect sizes of individual studies. Twenty-five studies met eligibility criteria. Use of statins was significantly associated with a reduced risk of all-caused dementia (k\,=\,16 studies, adjusted RR (aRR)\,=\,0.849, 95\% CI\,=\,0.787\textendash 0.916, p\,=\,0.000), AD (k\,=\,14, aRR\,=\,0.719, 95\% CI\,=\,0.576\textendash 0.899, p\,=\,0.004), and MCI (k\,=\,6, aRR\,=\,0.737, 95\% CI\,=\,0.556\textendash 0.976, p\,=\,0.033), but no meaningful effects on incident VaD (k\,=\,3, aRR\,=\,1.012, 95\% CI\,=\,0.620\textendash 1.652, p\,=\,0.961). Subgroup analysis suggested that hydrophilic statins were associated with reduced risk of all-caused dementia (aRR\,=\,0.877; CI\,=\,0.818\textendash 0.940; p\,=\,0.000) and possibly lower AD risk (aRR\,=\,0.619; CI\,=\,0.383\textendash 1.000; p\,=\,0.050). Lipophilic statins were associated with reduced risk of AD (aRR\,=\,0.639; CI\,=\,0.449\textendash 0.908; p\,=\,0.013) but not all-caused dementia (aRR\,=\,0.738; CI\,=\,0.475\textendash 1.146; p\,=\,0.176). In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests that the use of statins may reduce the risk of all-type dementia, AD, and MCI, but not of incident VaD.},

The SABV policy requires researchers to factor sex into the design, analysis, and reporting of vertebrate animal and human studies. The policy was implemented as it has become increasingly clear that male/female differences extend well beyond reproductive and hormonal issues. Implementation of the policy is also meant to address inattention to sex influences in biomedical research. Sex affects: cell physiology, metabolism, and many other biological functions; symptoms and manifestations of disease; and responses to treatment. For example, sex has profound influences in neuroscience, from circuitry to physiology to pain perception. Extending beyond the robust efforts of NIH to ensure that women are included in clinical trials, the SABV policy also includes rigorous preclinical experimental designs that inform clinical research. Additionally, the NIH has engaged journal editors and publishers to facilitate reproducibility by addressing rigor and promoting transparency through scientifically appropriate sex-specific study results reporting. The Sex And Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines were developed to assist researchers and journal editors in reporting sex and gender information in publications [1].},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}This Review is intended to help clinicians, patients, and the public make informed decisions about statin therapy for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. It explains how the evidence that is available from randomised controlled trials yields reliable information about both the efficacy and safety of statin therapy. In addition, it discusses how claims that statins commonly cause adverse effects reflect a failure to recognise the limitations of other sources of evidence about the effects of treatment. Large-scale evidence from randomised trials shows that statin therapy reduces the risk of major vascular events (ie, coronary deaths or myocardial infarctions, strokes, and coronary revascularisation procedures) by about one-quarter for \emph{each} mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol during \emph{each} year (after the first) that it continues to be taken. The absolute benefits of statin therapy depend on an individual's absolute risk of occlusive vascular events and the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol that is achieved. For example, lowering LDL cholesterol by 2 mmol/L (77 mg/dL) with an effective low-cost statin regimen (eg, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, costing about \textsterling 2 per month) for 5 years in 10 000 patients would typically prevent major vascular events from occurring in about 1000 patients (ie, 10\% absolute benefit) with pre-existing occlusive vascular disease (secondary prevention) and in 500 patients (ie, 5\% absolute benefit) who are at increased risk but have not yet had a vascular event (primary prevention). Statin therapy has been shown to reduce vascular disease risk during each year it continues to be taken, so larger absolute benefits would accrue with more prolonged therapy, and these benefits persist long term. The only serious adverse events that have been shown to be caused by long-term statin therapy\textemdash ie, adverse \emph{effects} of the statin\textemdash are myopathy (defined as muscle pain or weakness combined with large increases in blood concentrations of creatine kinase), new-onset diabetes mellitus, and, probably, haemorrhagic stroke. Typically, treatment of 10 000 patients for 5 years with an effective regimen (eg, atorvastatin 40 mg daily) would cause about 5 cases of myopathy (one of which might progress, if the statin therapy is not stopped, to the more severe condition of rhabdomyolysis), 50\textendash 100 new cases of diabetes, and 5\textendash 10 haemorrhagic strokes. However, any adverse impact of these side-effects on major vascular events has already been taken into account in the estimates of the absolute benefits. Statin therapy may cause symptomatic adverse events (eg, muscle pain or weakness) in up to about 50\textendash 100 patients (ie, 0{$\cdot$}5\textendash 1{$\cdot$}0\% absolute harm) per 10 000 treated for 5 years. However, placebo-controlled randomised trials have shown definitively that almost all of the symptomatic adverse events that are attributed to statin therapy in routine practice are not actually caused by it (ie, they represent misattribution). The large-scale evidence available from randomised trials also indicates that it is unlikely that large absolute excesses in other serious adverse events still await discovery. Consequently, any further findings that emerge about the effects of statin therapy would not be expected to alter materially the balance of benefits and harms. It is, therefore, of concern that exaggerated claims about side-effect rates with statin therapy may be responsible for its under-use among individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular events. For, whereas the rare cases of myopathy and any muscle-related symptoms that are attributed to statin therapy generally resolve rapidly when treatment is stopped, the heart attacks or strokes that may occur if statin therapy is stopped unnecessarily can be devastating.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In epidemiologic cohort studies of chronic diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, confounding by age can bias the estimated effects of risk factors under study. With Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling in such studies, it would generally be recommended that chronological age be handled nonparametrically as the primary time scale. However, studies involving baseline measurements of biomarkers or other factors frequently use follow-up time since measurement as the primary time scale, with no explicit justification. The effects of age are adjusted for by modeling age at entry as a parametric covariate. Parametric adjustment raises the question of model adequacy, in that it assumes a known functional relationship between age and disease, whereas using age as the primary time scale does not. We illustrate this graphically and show intuitively why the parametric approach to age adjustment using follow-up time as the primary time scale provides a poor approximation to age-specific incidence. Adequate parametric adjustment for age could require extensive modeling, which is wasteful, given the simplicity of using age as the primary time scale. Furthermore, the underlying hazard with follow-up time based on arbitrary timing of study initiation may have no inherent meaning in terms of risk. Given the potential for biased risk estimates, age should be considered as the preferred time scale for proportional-hazards regression with epidemiologic follow-up data when confounding by age is a concern.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In meta-analysis, researchers combine the results of individual studies to arrive at cumulative conclusions. Meta-analysts sometimes include "grey literature" in their evidential base, which includes unpublished studies and studies published outside widely available journals. Because grey literature is a source of data that might not employ peer review, critics have questioned the validity of its data and the results of meta-analyses that include it. OBJECTIVE: To examine evidence regarding whether grey literature should be included in meta-analyses and strategies to manage grey literature in quantitative synthesis. METHODS: This article reviews evidence on whether the results of studies published in peer-reviewed journals are representative of results from broader samplings of research on a topic as a rationale for inclusion of grey literature. Strategies to enhance access to grey literature are addressed. RESULTS: The most consistent and robust difference between published and grey literature is that published research is more likely to contain results that are statistically significant. Effect size estimates of published research are about one-third larger than those of unpublished studies. Unfunded and small sample studies are less likely to be published. Yet, importantly, methodological rigor does not differ between published and grey literature. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analyses that exclude grey literature likely (a) over-represent studies with statistically significant findings, (b) inflate effect size estimates, and (c) provide less precise effect size estimates than meta-analyses including grey literature. Meta-analyses should include grey literature to fully reflect the existing evidential base and should assess the impact of methodological variations through moderator analysis.},

  abstract = {Objectives Appropriate reporting is central to the application of findings from research to clinical practice. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations consist of a checklist of 22 items that provide guidance on the reporting of cohort, case\textendash control and cross-sectional studies, in order to facilitate critical appraisal and interpretation of results. STROBE was published in October 2007 in several journals including The Lancet, BMJ, Annals of Internal Medicine and PLoS Medicine. Within the framework of the revision of the STROBE recommendations, the authors examined the context and circumstances in which the STROBE statement was used in the past. Design The authors searched the Web of Science database in August 2010 for articles which cited STROBE and examined a random sample of 100 articles using a standardised, piloted data extraction form. The use of STROBE in observational studies and systematic reviews (including meta-analyses) was classified as appropriate or inappropriate. The use of STROBE to guide the reporting of observational studies was considered appropriate. Inappropriate uses included the use of STROBE as a tool to assess the methodological quality of studies or as a guideline on how to design and conduct studies. Results The authors identified 640 articles that cited STROBE. In the random sample of 100 articles, about half were observational studies (32\%) or systematic reviews (19\%). Comments, editorials and letters accounted for 15\%, methodological articles for 8\%, and recommendations and narrative reviews for 26\% of articles. Of the 32 observational studies, 26 (81\%) made appropriate use of STROBE, and three uses (10\%) were considered inappropriate. Among 19 systematic reviews, 10 (53\%) used STROBE inappropriately as a tool to assess study quality. Conclusions The STROBE reporting recommendations are frequently used inappropriately in systematic reviews and meta-analyses as an instrument to assess the methodological quality of observational studies.},

We develop the one-stage method as a linear mixed model and present the main aspects of the methodology, including model specification, estimation, testing, prediction, goodness-of-fit, model comparison, and quantification of between-studies heterogeneity. Using both fictitious and real data from a published meta-analysis, we illustrated the main features of the proposed methodology and compared it to a traditional two-stage analysis. In a one-stage approach, the pooled curve and estimates of the between-studies heterogeneity are based on the whole set of studies without any exclusion. Thus, even complex curves (splines, spike at zero exposure) defined by several parameters can be estimated. We showed how the one-stage method may facilitate several applications, in particular quantification of heterogeneity over the exposure range, prediction of marginal and conditional curves, and comparison of alternative models. The one-stage method for meta-analysis of non-linear curves is implemented in the dosresmeta R package. It is particularly suited for dose\textendash response meta-analyses of aggregated where the complexity of the research question is better addressed by including all the studies.},

We review the pipeline of drugs and biologics in clinical trials for the treatment of AD. We use the Common Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Research Ontology (CADRO) to classify treatment targets and mechanisms of action. We review our annual pipeline reports for the past 5 years to provide longitudinal insight into clinical trials and drug development for AD. Methods We reviewed ClinicalTrials.gov as of February 27, 2020, and identified all trials of pharmacologic agents currently being developed for treatment of AD as represented on this widely used U.S. Food and Drug Administration registry. Results There are 121 agents in clinical trials for the treatment of AD. Twenty-nine agents are in 36 Phase 3 trials, 65 agents are in 73 Phase 2 trials, and 27 agents are in 27 Phase 1 trials. Twelve agents in trials target cognitive enhancement and 12 are intended to treat neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms. There are 97 agents in disease modification trials. Compared to the 2019 pipeline, there is an increase in the number of disease-modifying agents targeting pathways other than amyloid or tau. Discussion The 2020 pipeline has innovations in clinical trials and treatment targets that provide hope for greater success in AD drug development programs. Review of clinical trials over the past 5 years show that there is progressive emphasis on non-amyloid targets, including candidate treatments for inflammation, synapse and neuronal protection, vascular factors, neurogenesis, and epigenetic interventions. There has been a marked growth in repurposed agents in the pipeline.},

The literature was reviewed for articles published between 1990-2016 by using the keywords linked to MVAD. Neuropathological studies indicate that MVAD is a very common pathological finding in the elderly with a prevalence about of 22\%. The distinction between Alzheimer's dementia and vascular dementia (VD) is complex because their clinical presentation can overlap. There are international criteria for the MVAD diagnosis. The pharmacologic therapy shows modest clinical benefits that are similar among all drugs used in patients with Alzheimer's dementia and VD. The non-pharmacologic therapy includes the rigorous management of cardiovascular risk factors (especially hypertension) and the promotion of a healthy diet. The diagnosis and treatment of MVAD cannot be improved without further studies. Currently available medications provide only modest clinical benefits once a patient has developed MVAD. In subjects at risk, the antihypertensive therapy and healthy diet should be recommend for preventing or slowing the progression of MVAD.},

Study Design and Setting Prospective observational study using electronic medical records of individuals aged 55\textendash 84 with coronary heart disease from {$>$}500 practices in the United Kingdom between 2000 and~2010. Results The intention-to-treat mortality hazard ratio (95\% confidence interval) was 0.90 (0.84, 0.97) for statins vs. no treatment, 0.88 (0.73, 1.06) for statins plus antihypertensives vs. no treatment, and 0.91 (0.77, 1.06) for atorvastatin vs. simvastatin. When censoring nonadherent person-times, the per-protocol mortality hazard ratio was 0.74 (0.64, 0.85) for statins vs. no treatment, 0.55 (0.35, 0.87) for statins plus antihypertensives vs. no treatment, and 1.13 (0.88, 1.45) for atorvastatin vs. simvastatin. We estimated per-protocol hazard ratios for a 5-year treatment using different dose-response marginal structural models and standardized survival curves for each target trial using intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.

Study Design and Setting Key features of included studies were poorly reported in a systematic review of diabetes quality improvement interventions. We developed a survey to request additional information from contact authors. After three email contact attempts, only 76 of 279 authors (27\%) had completed the survey. In this study, we randomly assigned nonresponding authors to contact by telephone calling vs. continued emailing to compare the effect of these strategies on response proportions and research costs. Results We randomized 87 authors to telephone and 89 to email contact. Telephone contact increased survey completion (36.7\% vs. 20.2\%; adjusted risk difference of 15.6\% [95\% confidence interval: 2.90\%, 28.4\%]; adjusted odds ratio 2.26 [95\% confidence interval: 1.10, 4.76]) but required more time to deliver (20 vs. 10~hours in total; 14 vs. 7~minutes per randomized author; 26 vs. 4~weeks), and cost more (total intervention cost of \$504 Canadian dollars vs. \$252 for the telephone and email arm, respectively). Conclusion Contacting nonresponding authors of included studies by telephone increased response compared with emailing but required more investigator time and had higher cost.},

These reviews lack consistent assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect before pooling. We discuss a random effects approach to combining evidence from a series of experiments comparing two treatments. This approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. The model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations. We suggest a simple noniterative procedure for characterizing the distribution of treatment effects in a series of studies.},

Distinctive and reliable biomarkers of AD are now available through structural MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analyses. This progress provides the impetus for our proposal of revised diagnostic criteria for AD. Our framework was developed to capture both the earliest stages, before full-blown dementia, as well as the full spectrum of the illness. These new criteria are centred on a clinical core of early and significant episodic memory impairment. They stipulate that there must also be at least one or more abnormal biomarkers among structural neuroimaging with MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis of amyloid {$\beta$} or tau proteins. The timeliness of these criteria is highlighted by the many drugs in development that are directed at changing pathogenesis, particularly at the production and clearance of amyloid {$\beta$} as well as at the hyperphosphorylation state of tau. Validation studies in existing and prospective cohorts are needed to advance these criteria and optimise their sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.},

We randomly selected 100 of these articles and examined them further. Sixty articles reported on actual meta-analyses, and 40 were methodological papers, editorials, and traditional reviews (1). Among the meta-analyses, about half were based on observational studies, mainly cohort and case-control studies of medical interventions or aetiological associations. View this table: Characteristics of 100 articles randomly selected from articles published in 1995 and indexed in Medline with keyword ``meta-analysis'' The randomised controlled trial is the principal research design in the evaluation of medical interventions. However, aetiological hypotheses\textemdash for example, those relating common exposures to the occurrence of disease\textemdash cannot generally be tested in randomised experiments. Does breathing other people's tobacco smoke cause lung cancer, drinking coffee cause coronary heart disease, and eating a diet rich in saturated fat cause breast cancer? Studies of such ``menaces of daily life''6 use observational designs or examine the presumed biological mechanisms in the laboratory. In these situations the risks involved are generally small, but once a large proportion of the population is exposed, the potential public health implications of these associations\textemdash if they are causal\textemdash can be striking. Analyses of observational data also have a role in medical effectiveness research.7 The evidence available from clinical trials will rarely answer all the important questions. Most trials are conducted to establish efficacy and safety of a single agent in a specific clinical situation. Owing to the limited size of such trials, less common adverse effects of drugs may only be detected in case-control \ldots},

The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalisability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September, 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. 18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed explanation and elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the websites of \emph{PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine}, and \emph{Epidemiology}. We hope that the STROBE statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Findings Men who followed four or five of the behaviours had an odds ratio (OR) and confidence intervals (CI) for diabetes, corrected for age and social class, of 0.50 (95\% CI: 0.19, 1.31; P for trend with increasing numbers of healthy behaviours {$<$}0.0005). For vascular disease the OR was 0.50 (95\% CI: 0.30, 0.84; P for trend {$<$}0.0005), and there was a delay in vascular disease events of up to 12 years. Cancer incidence was not significantly related to lifestyle although there was a reduction associated with non-smoking (OR: 0.65; 95\% CI: 0.54, 0.79). All-cause mortality was reduced in men following four or five behaviours (OR 0.40; 95\% CI: 0.24, 0.67; P for trend {$<$}0.005). After further adjustment for NART, the OR for men following four or five healthy behaviours was 0.36 (95\% CI: 0.12, 1.09; P for trend {$<$}0.001) for cognitive impairment, and 0.36 (95\% CI: 0.07, 1.99; P for trend {$<$}0.02) for dementia. The adoption of a healthy lifestyle by men was low and appears not to have changed during the subsequent 30 years, with under 1\% of men following all five of the behaviours and 5\% reporting four or more in 1979 and in 2009. Interpretation A healthy lifestyle is associated with increased disease-free survival and reduced cognitive impairment but the uptake remains low.},

With their use comes the opportunity for large-scale, high-quality studies that can address questions not easily answered by randomised clinical trials or classical cohort studies involving bespoke data collection. However, the use of EHRs generates challenges in terms of ensuring methodological rigour, a potential problem when studying complex chronic diseases such as diabetes. This review describes the promises and potential of EHRs in the context of diabetes research and outlines key areas for caution with examples. We consider the difficulties in identifying and classifying diabetes patients, in distinguishing between prevalent and incident cases and in dealing with the complexities of diabetes progression and treatment. We also discuss the dangers of introducing time-related biases and describe the problems of inconsistent data recording, missing data and confounding. Throughout, we provide practical recommendations for good practice in conducting EHR studies and interpreting their results.},

  abstract = {Cholesterol and triglycerides are insoluble in water and therefore these lipids must be transported in association with proteins. Lipoproteins are complex particles with a central core containing cholesterol esters and triglycerides surrounded by free cholesterol, phospholipids, and apolipoproteins, which facilitate lipoprotein formation and function. Plasma lipoproteins can be divided into seven classes based on size, lipid composition, and apolipoproteins (chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, VLDL, IDL, LDL, HDL, and Lp (a)). Chylomicron remnants, VLDL, IDL, LDL, and Lp (a) are all pro-atherogenic while HDL is anti-atherogenic. Apolipoproteins have four major functions including 1) serving a structural role, 2) acting as ligands for lipoprotein receptors, 3) guiding the formation of lipoproteins, and 4) serving as activators or inhibitors of enzymes involved in the metabolism of lipoproteins. The exogenous lipoprotein pathway starts with the incorporation of dietary lipids into chylomicrons in the intestine. In the circulation, the triglycerides carried in chylomicrons are metabolized in muscle and adipose tissue by lipoprotein lipase releasing free fatty acids, which are subsequently metabolized by muscle and adipose tissue, and chylomicron remnants are formed. Chylomicron remnants are then taken up by the liver. The endogenous lipoprotein pathway begins in the liver with the formation of VLDL. The triglycerides carried in VLDL are metabolized in muscle and adipose tissue by lipoprotein lipase releasing free fatty acids and IDL are formed. The IDL are further metabolized to LDL, which are taken up by the LDL receptor in numerous tissues including the liver, the predominant site of uptake. Reverse cholesterol transport begins with the formation of nascent HDL by the liver and intestine. These small HDL particles can then acquire cholesterol and phospholipids that are effluxed from cells, a process mediated by ABCA1 resulting in the formation of mature HDL. Mature HDL can acquire addition cholesterol from cells via ABCG1, SR-B1, or passive diffusion. The HDL then transports the cholesterol to the liver either directly by interacting with hepatic SR-B1 or indirectly by transferring the cholesterol to VLDL or LDL, a process facilitated by CETP. Cholesterol efflux from macrophages to HDL plays an important role in protecting from the development of atherosclerosis.

We tested the hypothesis that SBP is causally associated with the rate of rise in SBP with age by evaluating the effect of 12 polymorphisms associated with lower SBP on the age-related rate of rise in SBP in a series of meta-regression analyses involving {$\leq$}199 477 participants in 63 studies. We then evaluated the effect of these polymorphisms on the odds of coronary heart disease in 22,223 case and 64,762 control subjects and compared it with the effect of lower SBP observed in both prospective cohort studies and blood pressure-lowering randomized trials. All 12 polymorphisms were associated with both lower SBP and a slower age-related rise in SBP. The weighted mean effect of these 12 polymorphisms was associated with a 0.32-mm Hg lower SBP (P=1.79\texttimes 10(-7)) and a 0.093-mm Hg/decade slower age-related rise in SBP (P=3.05\texttimes 10(-5)). The effect of long-term exposure to lower SBP on coronary heart disease mediated by these polymorphisms was 2-fold greater than that observed in prospective cohort studies (P=0.006) and 3-fold greater than that observed in short-term blood pressure treatment trials (P=0.001). We conclude therefore that SBP seems to be causally associated with the rate of rise in SBP with age and has a cumulative effect on the risk of coronary heart disease.},

  abstract = {Aims: To appraise the clinical and genetic evidence that low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Methods and results: We assessed whether the association between LDL and ASCVD fulfils the criteria for causality by evaluating the totality of evidence from genetic studies, prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and randomized trials of LDL-lowering therapies. In clinical studies, plasma LDL burden is usually estimated by determination of plasma LDL cholesterol level (LDL-C). Rare genetic mutations that cause reduced LDL receptor function lead to markedly higher LDL-C and a dose-dependent increase in the risk of ASCVD, whereas rare variants leading to lower LDL-C are associated with a correspondingly lower risk of ASCVD. Separate meta-analyses of over 200 prospective cohort studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and randomized trials including more than 2 million participants with over 20 million person-years of follow-up and over 150\,000 cardiovascular events demonstrate a remarkably consistent dose-dependent log-linear association between the absolute magnitude of exposure of the vasculature to LDL-C and the risk of ASCVD; and this effect appears to increase with increasing duration of exposure to LDL-C. Both the naturally randomized genetic studies and the randomized intervention trials consistently demonstrate that any mechanism of lowering plasma LDL particle concentration should reduce the risk of ASCVD events proportional to the absolute reduction in LDL-C and the cumulative duration of exposure to lower LDL-C, provided that the achieved reduction in LDL-C is concordant with the reduction in LDL particle number and that there are no competing deleterious off-target effects. Conclusion: Consistent evidence from numerous and multiple different types of clinical and genetic studies unequivocally establishes that LDL causes ASCVD.},

We propose using a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis model to use information from all available cohorts while still adjusting for all the potential confounders. Our method uses both the fully adjusted and the partially adjusted estimated effects in the cohorts with full confounder information, together with an estimate of their within-cohort correlation.

However, single trials are typically underpowered for exploring whether participant characteristics, such as age or disease severity, determine an individual's response to treatment. A meta-analysis of multiple trials, particularly one where individual participant data (IPD) are available, provides greater power to investigate interactions between participant characteristics (covariates) and treatment effects. We use a published IPD meta-analysis to illustrate three broad approaches used for testing such interactions. Based on another systematic review of recently published IPD meta-analyses, we also show that all three approaches can be applied to aggregate data as well as IPD. We also summarise which methods of analysing and presenting interactions are in current use, and describe their advantages and disadvantages. We recommend that testing for interactions using within-trials information alone (the deft approach) becomes standard practice, alongside graphical presentation that directly visualises this.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Dementia refers to a syndrome that is characterised by progressive deterioration of cognitive functions. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as apathy, agitation, and depression, are also common. With increasing loss of function, a patient is gradually robbed of his or her independence. Eventually, placement in a nursing home may be necessary. Patients with dementia usually survive 7\textemdash 10 years after onset of symptoms. Dementia places a tremendous burden not only on caregivers, but also on society, and has already been established as one of the major challenges of this century.1 Epidemiology refers to the medical science that studies frequencies of disease.2 Measures of frequency that are often used in epidemiology are prevalence and incidence. The concept of prevalence refers to the number of patients with a disease at a certain moment in time, whereas measures of incidence reflect the number of new cases over time. Although important for health care planners, the knowledge of frequency of disease in itself is not the goal of epidemiology. Rather, the aim is to gain insight into the mechanisms that cause disease, eventually to be able to cure or prevent disease. Therefore, frequencies are studied in relation to determinants, or risk factors. Although marked as ``the epidemic of our century'', still surprisingly little is known about the epidemiology of dementia. In this chapter, a brief overview will be given of the epidemiology and risk factors of dementia. Furthermore, we comment on some specific methodological problems associated with studies in dementia. The syndrome of dementia may be caused by various underlying diseases, each characterised by a specific constellation of signs and symptoms in combination with a presumed underlying substrate of neuropathology (fig 1). Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia. It is a neurodegenerative disorder, generally assumed to be caused by neuritic plaques \ldots},

  abstract = {The atomic electrostatic potentials calculated by the CHELPG method have been shown to be sensitive indicators of the gas phase and solution properties of the statins. Solvation free energies in water, n-octanol and n-octane have been determined using the SMD solvent model. The percentage hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity (or lipophilicity) of the statins in solution have been determined using (a) the differences in solvation free energies between n-octanol and n-octane as a measure of hydrophilicity, and the solvation energy in octane as a measure of hydrophobicity (b) the sum of the atomic electrostatic charges on the hydrogen bonding and polar bonding nuclei of the common pharmacophore combined with a solvent measure of hydrophobicity, and (c) using the buried surface areas after statin binding to HMGCR to calculate the hydrophobicity of the bound statins. The data suggests that clinical definitions of statins as either ``hydrophilic'' or ``lipophilic'' based on experimental partition coefficients are misleading. An estimate of the binding energy between rosuvastatin and HMGCR has been made using: (a) a coulombic electrostatic interaction model, (b) the calculated desolvation and resolvation of the statin in water, and (c) the first shell transfer solvation energy as a proxy for the restructuring of the water molecules immediately adjacent to the active binding site of HMGCR prior to binding. Desolvation and resolvation of the statins before and after binding to HMGCR are major determinants of the energetics of the binding process. An analysis of the amphiphilic nature of lovastatin anion, acid and lactone and fluvastatin anion and their abilities to cross the blood brain barrier has indicated that this process may be dominated by desolvation and resolvation effects, rather than the statin molecular size or statin\textendash lipid interactions within the bilayer. The ionization energy and electron affinity of the statins are sensitive physical indicators of the ease that the various statins can undergo endogenous oxidative metabolism. The absolute chemical hardness is also an indicator of the stability of the statins, and may be a useful indicator for drug design.},

  abstract = {Neuron and synapse loss together with neurotransmitter dysfunction have, along with A{$\beta$} deposition and neurofibrillary tangles, been recognized as hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, clinical and preclinical studies point to neuronal loss and associated neurochemical alterations of several transmitter systems as a main factor underlying both cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Treatment for the cognitive decline in AD, based on early findings of a cholinergic deficit, has been in the clinic for more than a decade but provides only modest benefit in most patients. Therefore there is still considerable scope for new treatments that demonstrate greater efficacy against cognitive dysfunction in spite of the fact that the mainstays of current treatments, the cholinesterase inhibitors Aricept, Exelon and Reminyl (Razadyne) will become generic over the next few years. However, the most important area for drug development is for the treatment of behavioural disturbance in AD since many existing treatments have limited efficacy and have potentially life-threatening side effects. This review examines the neurochemical underpinning of both cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia and provides some basis for rational drug development.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The world continues to face an ongoing viral pandemic that presents a serious threat to human health. The virus underlying the COVID-19 disease, SARS-CoV-2, has caused over 3.2 million confirmed cases and 220,000 deaths between January and April 2020. Although the last pandemic of respiratory disease of viral origin swept the globe only a decade ago, the way science operates and responds to current events has experienced a paradigm shift in the interim. The scientific community has responded rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic, releasing over 16,000 COVID-19 related scientific articles within 4 months of the first confirmed case, of which at least 6,000 were hosted by preprint servers. We focused our analysis on bioRxiv and medRxiv, two growing preprint servers for biomedical research, investigating the attributes of COVID-19 preprints, their access and usage rates, characteristics of their sharing on online platforms, and the relationship between preprints and their published articles. Our data provides evidence for increased scientific and public engagement (COVID-19 preprints are accessed and distributed at least 15 times more than non-COVID-19 preprints) and changes in journalistic practice with reference to preprints. We also find evidence for changes in preprinting and publishing behaviour: COVID-19 preprints are shorter, with fewer panels and tables, and reviewed faster. Our results highlight the unprecedented role of preprints and preprint servers in the dissemination of COVID-19 science, and the likely long-term impact of the pandemic on the scientific publishing landscape.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This modelling approach extends the standard two-stage analysis used to combine results across different sub-groups or populations. The most straightforward application is for the meta-analysis of non-linear relationships, described for example by regression coefficients of splines or other functions, but the methodology easily generalizes to any setting where complex associations are described by multiple correlated parameters. The modelling framework of multivariate meta-analysis is implemented in the package mvmeta within the statistical environment R. As an illustrative example, we propose a two-stage analysis for investigating the non-linear exposure\textendash response relationship between temperature and non-accidental mortality using time-series data from multiple cities. Multivariate meta-analysis represents a useful analytical tool for studying complex associations through a two-stage procedure. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Significant emerging evidence has linked cholesterol, {$\beta$}-amyloid and AD, and several studies have shown a reduced risk for AD and dementia in populations treated with statins. However, while some clinical trials evaluating statins in general AD populations have been conducted, these resulted in no significant therapeutic benefit. By focusing on subgroups of the AD population, it may be possible to detect endotypes responsive to statin therapy. Methods Here we investigate the possible protective and therapeutic effect of statins in AD through the analysis of datasets of integrated clinical trials, and prospective observational studies. Results Re-analysis of AD patient-level data from failed clinical trials suggested by trend that use of simvastatin may slow the progression of cognitive decline, and to a greater extent in ApoE4 homozygotes. Evaluation of continual long-term use of various statins, in participants from multiple studies at baseline, revealed better cognitive performance in statin users. These findings were supported in an additional, observational cohort where the incidence of AD was significantly lower in statin users, and ApoE4/ApoE4-genotyped AD patients treated with statins showed better cognitive function over the course of 10-year follow-up. Conclusions These results indicate that the use of statins may benefit all AD patients with potentially greater therapeutic efficacy in those homozygous for ApoE4.},

In patients with established CAD or atherosclerosis in other vascular beds, or in patients at high risk of developing CAD, lowering serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been associated with a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and total mortality. Recently, large-scale studies have shown that lowering the LDL-C to less than 2.0 mmol/L is associated with a reduction of major cardiac events in patients with established CAD. Therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) has had a major impact on preventive cardiology. Not all patients reach recommended LDL-C targets on currently available statins. Ezetimibe is a selective inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption that results in an additional 15\% to 25\% reduction of LDL-C. The recommended dosage is 10 mg once daily; it is safe and well tolerated. Elevations in transaminase and creatine kinase occur in approximately 1\% of subjects. Ezetimibe is suggested for patients who do not reach recommended LDL-C targets on an optimal dosage of statins alone. While the effects of ezetimibe on atherosclerosis have not been ascertained, clinical trials have consistently shown that the reduction in serum cholesterol correlates with a decrease in major cardiovascular events, irrespective of the method used to reduce cholesterol.},

We carried out a nested randomised trial comparing two different approaches for contacting authors to request additional data for a systematic review. Participants Participants were authors of published reports of prevention or treatment trials in stroke in which there was central adjudication of events. A primary and secondary research active author were selected as contacts for each trial. Interventions Authors were randomised to be sent either a short email with a protocol of the systematic review attached (`Short') or a longer email that contained detailed information and without the protocol attached (`Long'). A maximum of two emails were sent to each author to obtain a response. The unit of analysis was trial, accounting for clustering by author. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was whether a response was received from authors. Secondary outcomes included time to response, number of reminders needed before a response was received and whether authors agreed to collaborate. Results 88 trials with 76 primary authors were identified in the systematic review, and of these, 36 authors were randomised to Short (trials=45) and 40 to Long (trials=43). Responses were received for 69 trials. There was no evidence of a difference in response rate between trial arms (Short vs Long, OR 1.10, 95\% CI 0.36 to 3.33). There was no evidence of a difference in time to response between trial arms (Short vs Long, HR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.55 to 1.51). In total, 27\% of authors responded within a day and 22\% of authors never responded. Conclusions There was no evidence to suggest that email format had an impact on the number of responses received when acquiring data for a systematic review involving stroke trials or the time taken to receive these responses.},

  abstract = {Background WHO has called for increased testing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but countries have taken different approaches and the effectiveness of alternative strategies is unknown. We aimed to investigate the potential impact of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on infectiousness and PCR test sensitivity over time since infection. We estimated the reduction in the effective reproduction number (R) achieved by testing and isolating symptomatic individuals, regular screening of high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms, and quarantine of contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases identified through test-and-trace protocols. The expected effectiveness of different testing strategies was defined as the percentage reduction in R. We reviewed data on the performance of antibody tests reported by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and examined their implications for the use of so-called immunity passports. Findings If all individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 self-isolated and self-isolation was 100\% effective in reducing onwards transmission, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals would result in a reduction in R of 47\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI] 32\textendash 55). PCR testing to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection soon after symptom onset could reduce the number of individuals needing to self-isolate, but would also reduce the effectiveness of self-isolation (around 10\% would be false negatives). Weekly screening of health-care workers and other high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms by use of PCR testing is estimated to reduce their contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 23\% (95\% UI 16\textendash 40), on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, assuming results are available at 24 h. The effectiveness of test and trace depends strongly on coverage and the timeliness of contact tracing, potentially reducing R by 26\% (95\% UI 14\textendash 35) on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, if 80\% of cases and contacts are identified and there is immediate testing following symptom onset and quarantine of contacts within 24 h. Among currently available antibody tests, performance has been highly variable, with specificity around 90\% or lower for rapid diagnostic tests and 95\textendash 99\% for laboratory-based ELISA and chemiluminescent assays. Interpretation Molecular testing can play an important role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially among health-care workers and other high-risk groups, but no single strategy will reduce R below 1 at current levels of population immunity. Immunity passports based on antibody tests or tests for infection face substantial technical, legal, and ethical challenges. Funding UK Medical Research Council.},

This paper explores the origin of these limitations, and introduces an alternative and more stable agreement coefficient referred to as the AC1 coefficient. Also proposed are new variance estimators for the multiple-rater generalized {$\pi$} and AC1 statistics, whose validity does not depend upon the hypothesis of independence between raters. This is an improvement over existing alternative variances, which depend on the independence assumption. A Monte-Carlo simulation study demonstrates the validity of these variance estimators for confidence interval construction, and confirms the value of AC1 as an improved alternative to existing inter-rater reliability statistics.},

In this paper, we propose a simple procedure for calculating Krippendorff's alpha that involves simple calculations similar to those needed to obtain the Pi coefficient of Fleiss (1971). We will propose a close expression for computing its variance, as well as a new interpretation based on the notion of weighting. Additionally, we will present some alternative agreement coefficients, which address the classical problem of the paradoxes associated with Cohen's Kappa, and described by Cicchetti and Feinstein (1990) and Feinstein and Cicchetti (1990).},

Perhaps the most useful outputs of a systematic map are an interactive database of studies and their meta-data, along with visualisations of this database. Despite the rapid increase in systematic mapping as an evidence synthesis method, there is currently a lack of Open Source software for producing interactive visualisations of systematic map databases. In April 2018, as attendees at and coordinators of the first ever Evidence Synthesis Hackathon in Stockholm, we decided to address this issue by developing an R-based tool called EviAtlas, an Open Access (i.e. free to use) and Open Source (i.e. software code is freely accessible and reproducible) tool for producing interactive, attractive tables and figures that summarise the evidence base. Here, we present our tool which includes the ability to generate vital visualisations for systematic maps and reviews as follows: a complete data table; a spatially explicit geographical information system (Evidence Atlas); Heat Maps that cross-tabulate two or more variables and display the number of studies belonging to multiple categories; and standard descriptive plots showing the nature of the evidence base, for example the number of studies published per year or number of studies per country. We believe that EviAtlas will provide a stimulus for the development of other exciting tools to facilitate evidence synthesis.},

  abstract = {Cholinergic synapses are ubiquitous in the human central nervous system. Their high density in the thalamus, striatum, limbic system, and neocortex suggest that cholinergic transmission is likely to be critically important for memory, learning, attention and other higher brain functions. Several lines of research suggest additional roles for cholinergic systems in overall brain homeostasis and plasticity. As such, the brain's cholinergic system occupies a central role in ongoing research related to normal cognition and age-related cognitive decline, including dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. The cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease centres on the progressive loss of limbic and neocortical cholinergic innervation. Neurofibrillary degeneration in the basal forebrain is believed to be the primary cause for the dysfunction and death of forebrain cholinergic neurons, giving rise to a widespread presynaptic cholinergic denervation. Cholinesterase inhibitors increase the availability of acetylcholine at synapses in the brain and are one of the few drug therapies that have been proven clinically useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease dementia, thus validating the cholinergic system as an important therapeutic target in the disease. This review includes an overview of the role of the cholinergic system in cognition and an updated understanding of how cholinergic deficits in Alzheimer's disease interact with other aspects of disease pathophysiology, including plaques composed of amyloid-{$\beta$} proteins. This review also documents the benefits of cholinergic therapies at various stages of Alzheimer's disease and during long-term follow-up as visualized in novel imaging studies. The weight of the evidence supports the continued value of cholinergic drugs as a standard, cornerstone pharmacological approach in Alzheimer's disease, particularly as we look ahead to future combination therapies that address symptoms as well as disease progression.},

  abstract = {Background The Risk of Bias (RoB) tool is used to assess internal validity of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Our objectives were to: 1) evaluate inter-rater agreement of the RoB tool; 2) determine the time to access supplemental study information; 3) compare the RoB tool with the Jadad scale and Schulz allocation concealment (AC); and 4) examine the relationship between RoB and effect estimates. Methods We conducted a systematic review of long-acting beta agonists (LABA) combined with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for adults with persistent asthma. Two reviewers independently assessed 107 trials using RoB, Jadad, and AC. One reviewer searched for study protocols. We assessed inter-rater agreement using weighted Kappa ({$\kappa$}) and the correlation between tools using Kendall's Tau ({$\tau$}). Mean differences in effect sizes for RCTs with different RoB were calculated using inverse variance method and random effects model. Results Trials had good Jadad scores (median 4, IQR 3-4); however, 85\% had unclear AC and 87\% high RoB. The factor that most influenced RoB was the potential inappropriate influence of study sponsors (95\% industry funded). Agreement on RoB domains was fair ({$\kappa$} = 0.40) to almost perfect ({$\kappa$} = 0.86), and moderate for overall RoB ({$\kappa$} = 0.41). Median time to complete RoB assessments was 21 minutes (IQR 14-27) and 12 minutes (IQR 9-16) to search for protocols. Protocols were identified for 5/42 studies (12\%); in 3 cases the assessment of selective outcome reporting changed. There was low correlation between overall RoB vs. Jadad ({$\tau$} = 0.04, p = 0.3) and AC ({$\tau$} = -0.02, p = 0.7). Analyses comparing effect estimates and risk showed no important patterns. Conclusions Inter-rater agreement on RoB assessments was better than previously reported suggesting that review-specific guidelines are important. The correlation between RoB and Jadad was low suggesting measurement of different constructs (risk of bias vs. quality of reporting). The extensive involvement of the pharmaceutical industry in this LABA/ICS research should raise concerns about potential overestimates of treatment effects.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}h3{$>$}Background{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Throughout the usual LDL cholesterol range in Western populations, lower blood concentrations are associated with lower cardiovascular disease risk. In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}20 536 UK adults (aged 40\textendash 80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85\%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17\%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These "intention-to-treat" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85\% minus 17\%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12{$\cdot$}9\%] deaths among 10 269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14{$\cdot$}7\%] among 10 267 allocated placebo; p=0{$\cdot$}0003), due to a highly significant 18\% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5{$\cdot$}7\%] \emph{vs} 707 [6{$\cdot$}9\%]; p=0{$\cdot$}0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1{$\cdot$}9\%] \emph{vs} 230 [2{$\cdot$}2\%]; p=0{$\cdot$}07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5{$\cdot$}3\%] \emph{vs} 570 [5{$\cdot$}6\%]; p=0{$\cdot$}4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8{$\cdot$}7\%] \emph{vs} 1212 [11{$\cdot$}8\%]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4{$\cdot$}3\%] \emph{vs} 585 [5{$\cdot$}7\%]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), and for coronary or noncoronary revascularisation (939 [9{$\cdot$}1\%] \emph{vs} 1205 [11{$\cdot$}7\%]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24\% (SE 3; 95\% CI 19\textendash 28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19{$\cdot$}8\%] \emph{vs} 2585 [25{$\cdot$}2\%] affected individuals; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and\textemdash most notably\textemdash even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0{$\cdot$}01\%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70\textendash 100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Design Series of randomised, placebo controlled n-of-1 trials. Setting Primary care across 50 sites in the United Kingdom, December 2016 to April 2018. Participants 200 participants who had recently stopped or were considering stopping treatment with statins because of muscle symptoms. Interventions Participants were randomised to a sequence of six double blinded treatment periods (two months each) of atorvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo. Main outcome measures At the end of each treatment period, participants rated their muscle symptoms on a visual analogue scale (0-10). The primary analysis compared symptom scores in the statin and placebo periods. Results 151 participants provided symptoms scores for at least one statin period and one placebo period and were included in the primary analysis. Overall, no difference in muscle symptom scores was found between the statin and placebo periods (mean difference statin minus placebo -0.11, 95\% confidence interval -0.36 to 0.14; P=0.40)). Withdrawals because of intolerable muscle symptoms were 18 participants (9\%) during a statin period and 13 (7\%) during a placebo period. Two thirds of those completing the trial reported restarting long term treatment with statins. Conclusions No overall effect of atorvastatin 20 mg on muscle symptoms compared with placebo was found in participants who had previously reported severe muscle symptoms when taking statins. Most people completing the trial intended to restart treatment with statins. N-of-1 trials can assess drug effects at the group level and guide individual treatment.

This assessment might be achieved by performing a statistical test for heterogeneity, by quantifying its magnitude, by quantifying its impact or by a combination of these. Patsopoulos, Evangelou and Ioannidis propose methods for examining the effect of excluding studies (or groups of studies) on an assessment of heterogeneity.1 Their methods offer benefits over the sometimes practiced `leave one out' approach to sensitivity analysis, by recognizing that the overall effect (against which heterogeneity is measured) changes each time an influential study is excluded. The authors offer a sequential approach (in which the overall effect and heterogeneity measure are re-estimated after the most influential study is removed at each iteration), and a combinatorial approach (in which groups of studies are removed). I suspect the sequential approach may often be performed informally in practice, whereby an obvious outlier is excluded, but another study then appears to be an outlier compared with the remaining studies and is in turn excluded. Of course, if heterogeneity permeates the entire set of studies, one might be tempted continue excluding studies to reduce heterogeneity until a single study remains. A predefined stopping rule (a `desired heterogeneity threshold', in the authors' terminology) may therefore appear to offer a useful way forward.},

  abstract = {When literature-based meta-analyses involve outcomes with skewed distributions, the best available data can sometimes be a mixture of results presented on the raw scale and results presented on the logarithmic scale. We review and develop methods for transforming between these results for two-group studies, such as clinical trials and prospective or cross-sectional epidemiological studies. These allow meta-analyses to be conducted using all studies and on a common scale. The methods can also be used to produce a meta-analysis of ratios of geometric means when skewed data are reported on the raw scale for every study. We compare three methods, two of which have alternative standard error formulae, in an application and in a series of simulation studies. We conclude that an approach based on a log-normal assumption for the raw data is reasonably robust to different true distributions; and we provide new standard error approximations for this method. An assumption can be made that the standard deviations in the two groups are equal. This increases precision of the estimates, but if incorrect can lead to very misleading results.

  abstract = {Objective To develop and validate version two of the QRISK cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (QRISK2) to provide accurate estimates of cardiovascular risk in patients from different ethnic groups in England and Wales and to compare its performance with the modified version of Framingham score recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Design Prospective open cohort study with routinely collected data from general practice, 1 January 1993 to 31 March 2008. Setting 531 practices in England and Wales contributing to the national QRESEARCH database. Participants 2.3 million patients aged 35-74 (over 16 million person years) with 140 000 cardiovascular events. Overall population (derivation and validation cohorts) comprised 2.22 million people who were white or whose ethnic group was not recorded, 22 013 south Asian, 11 595 black African, 10 402 black Caribbean, and 19 792 from Chinese or other Asian or other ethnic groups. Main outcome measures First (incident) diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, stroke, and transient ischaemic attack) recorded in general practice records or linked Office for National Statistics death certificates. Risk factors included self assigned ethnicity, age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, ratio of total serum cholesterol:high density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, family history of coronary heart disease in first degree relative under 60 years, Townsend deprivation score, treated hypertension, type 2 diabetes, renal disease, atrial fibrillation, and rheumatoid arthritis. Results The validation statistics indicated that QRISK2 had improved discrimination and calibration compared with the modified Framingham score. The QRISK2 algorithm explained 43\% of the variation in women and 38\% in men compared with 39\% and 35\%, respectively, by the modified Framingham score. Of the 112 156 patients classified as high risk (that is, {$\geq$}20\% risk over 10 years) by the modified Framingham score, 46 094 (41.1\%) would be reclassified at low risk with QRISK2. The 10 year observed risk among these reclassified patients was 16.6\% (95\% confidence interval 16.1\% to 17.0\%)\textemdash that is, below the 20\% treatment threshold. Of the 78 024 patients classified at high risk on QRISK2, 11 962 (15.3\%) would be reclassified at low risk by the modified Framingham score. The 10 year observed risk among these patients was 23.3\% (22.2\% to 24.4\%)\textemdash that is, above the 20\% threshold. In the validation cohort, the annual incidence rate of cardiovascular events among those with a QRISK2 score of {$\geq$}20\% was 30.6 per 1000 person years (29.8 to 31.5) for women and 32.5 per 1000 person years (31.9 to 33.1) for men. The corresponding figures for the modified Framingham equation were 25.7 per 1000 person years (25.0 to 26.3) for women and 26.4 (26.0 to 26.8) for men). At the 20\% threshold, the population identified by QRISK2 was at higher risk of a CV event than the population identified by the Framingham score. Conclusions Incorporating ethnicity, deprivation, and other clinical conditions into the QRISK2 algorithm for risk of cardiovascular disease improves the accuracy of identification of those at high risk in a nationally representative population. At the 20\% threshold, QRISK2 is likely to be a more efficient and equitable tool for treatment decisions for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. As the validation was performed in a similar population to the population from which the algorithm was derived, it potentially has a ``home advantage.'' Further validation in other populations is therefore advised.},

  abstract = {Objective To quantify the unintended effects of statins according to type, dose, and duration of use. Design Prospective open cohort study using routinely collected data. Setting 368 general practices in England and Wales supplying data to the QResearch database. Participants 2 004 692 patients aged 30-84 years of whom 225 922 (10.7\%) were new users of statins: 159 790 (70.7\%) were prescribed simvastatin, 50 328 (22.3\%) atorvastatin, 8103 (3.6\%) pravastatin, 4497 (1.9\%) rosuvastatin, and 3204 (1.4\%) fluvastatin. Methods Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate effects of statin type, dose, and duration of use. The number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated and numbers of additional or fewer cases estimated for 10 000 treated patients. Main outcome measure First recorded occurrence of cardiovascular disease, moderate or serious myopathic events, moderate or serious liver dysfunction, acute renal failure, venous thromboembolism, Parkinson's disease, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, cataract, osteoporotic fracture, gastric cancer, oesophageal cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, renal cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer. Results Individual statins were not significantly associated with risk of Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, venous thromboembolism, dementia, osteoporotic fracture, gastric cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, renal cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer. Statin use was associated with decreased risks of oesophageal cancer but increased risks of moderate or serious liver dysfunction, acute renal failure, moderate or serious myopathy, and cataract. Adverse effects were similar across statin types for each outcome except liver dysfunction where risks were highest for fluvastatin. A dose-response effect was apparent for acute renal failure and liver dysfunction. All increased risks persisted during treatment and were highest in the first year. After stopping treatment the risk of cataract returned to normal within a year in men and women. Risk of oesophageal cancer returned to normal within a year in women and within 1-3 years in men. Risk of acute renal failure returned to normal within 1-3 years in men and women, and liver dysfunction within 1-3 years in women and from three years in men. Based on the 20\% threshold for cardiovascular risk, for women the NNT with any statin to prevent one case of cardiovascular disease over five years was 37 (95\% confidence interval 27 to 64) and for oesophageal cancer was 1266 (850 to 3460) and for men the respective values were 33 (24 to 57) and 1082 (711 to 2807). In women the NNH for an additional case of acute renal failure over five years was 434 (284 to 783), of moderate or severe myopathy was 259 (186 to 375), of moderate or severe liver dysfunction was 136 (109 to 175), and of cataract was 33 (28 to 38). Overall, the NNHs and NNTs for men were similar to those for women, except for myopathy where the NNH was 91 (74 to 112). Conclusions Claims of unintended benefits of statins, except for oesophageal cancer, remain unsubstantiated, although potential adverse effects at population level were confirmed and quantified. Further studies are needed to develop utilities to individualise the risks so that patients at highest risk of adverse events can be monitored closely.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The inclusion of grey literature (i.e. literature that has not been formally published) in systematic reviews may help to overcome some of the problems of publication bias, which can arise due to the selective availability of data. OBJECTIVES: To review systematically research studies, which have investigated the impact of grey literature in meta-analyses of randomized trials of health care interventions. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Methodology Register (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 20 May 2005), the Science Citation Index (June 2005) and contacted researchers who may have carried out relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: A study was considered eligible for this review if it compared the effect of the inclusion and exclusion of grey literature on the results of a cohort of meta-analyses of randomized trials. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted from each report independently by two reviewers. The main outcome measure was an estimate of the impact of trials from the grey literature on the pooled effect estimates of the meta-analyses. Information was also collected on the area of health care, the number of meta-analyses, the number of trials, the number of trial participants, the year of publication of the trials, the language and country of publication of the trials, the number and type of grey and published literature, and methodological quality. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies met the inclusion criteria. All five studies showed that published trials showed an overall greater treatment effect than grey trials. This difference was statistically significant in one of the five studies. Data could be combined for three of the five studies. This showed that, on average, published trials showed a 9\% greater treatment effect than grey trials (ratio of odds ratios for grey versus published trials 1.09; 95\% CI 1.03-1.16). Overall there were more published trials included in the meta-analyses than grey trials (median 224 (IQR 108-365) versus 45(IQR 40-102)). Published trials had more participants on average. The most common types of grey literature were abstracts (55\%) and unpublished data (30\%). There is limited evidence to show whether grey trials are of poorer methodological quality than published trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that published trials tend to be larger and show an overall greater treatment effect than grey trials. This has important implications for reviewers who need to ensure they identify grey trials, in order to minimise the risk of introducing bias into their review.},

Like with all claims databases, there have been some validity concerns of studies using the NHIRD, such as the accuracy of diagnosis codes and issues around unmeasured confounders. Endeavors to validate diagnosed codes or to develop methodologic approaches to address unmeasured confounders have largely increased the reliability of NHIRD studies. Recently, Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) established a Health and Welfare Data Center (HWDC), a data repository site that centralizes the NHIRD and about 70 other health-related databases for data management and analyses. To strengthen the protection of data privacy, investigators are required to conduct on-site analysis at an HWDC through remote connection to MOHW servers. Although the tight regulation of this on-site analysis has led to inconvenience for analysts and has increased time and costs required for research, the HWDC has created opportunities for enriched dimensions of study by linking across the NHIRD and other databases. In the near future, researchers will have greater opportunity to distill knowledge from the NHIRD linked to hospital-based electronic medical records databases containing unstructured patient-level information by using artificial intelligence techniques, including machine learning and natural language processes. We believe that NHIRD with multiple data sources could represent a powerful research engine with enriched dimensions and could serve as a guiding light for real-world evidence-based medicine in Taiwan.},

  abstract = {Stratified medicine utilizes individual-level covariates that are associated with a differential treatment effect, also known as treatment-covariate interactions. When multiple trials are available, meta-analysis is used to help detect true treatment-covariate interactions by combining their data. Meta-regression of trial-level information is prone to low power and ecological bias, and therefore, individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses are preferable to examine interactions utilizing individual-level information. However, one-stage IPD models are often wrongly specified, such that interactions are based on amalgamating within- and across-trial information. We compare, through simulations and an applied example, fixed-effect and random-effects models for a one-stage IPD meta-analysis of time-to-event data where the goal is to estimate a treatment-covariate interaction. We show that it is crucial to centre patient-level covariates by their mean value in each trial, in order to separate out within-trial and across-trial information. Otherwise, bias and coverage of interaction estimates may be adversely affected, leading to potentially erroneous conclusions driven by ecological bias. We revisit an IPD meta-analysis of five epilepsy trials and examine age as a treatment effect modifier. The interaction is -0.011 (95\% CI: -0.019 to -0.003; p = 0.004), and thus highly significant, when amalgamating within-trial and across-trial information. However, when separating within-trial from across-trial information, the interaction is -0.007 (95\% CI: -0.019 to 0.005; p = 0.22), and thus its magnitude and statistical significance are greatly reduced. We recommend that meta-analysts should only use within-trial information to examine individual predictors of treatment effect and that one-stage IPD models should separate within-trial from across-trial information to avoid ecological bias. \textcopyright{} 2016 The Authors.

  abstract = {Missing data are unavoidable in epidemiological research, potentially leading to bias and loss of precision. Multiple imputation (MI) is widely advocated as an improvement over complete case analysis (CCA). However, contrary to widespread belief, CCA is preferable to MI in some situations.We provide guidance on choice of analysis when data are incomplete. Using causal diagrams to depict missingness mechanisms, we describe when CCA will not be biased by missing data and compare MI and CCA, with respect to bias and efficiency, in a range of missing data situations. We illustrate selection of an appropriate method in practice.For most regression models, CCA gives unbiased results when the chance of being a complete case does not depend on the outcome after taking the covariates into consideration, which includes situations where data are missing not at random. Consequently, there are situations in which CCA analyses are unbiased while MI analyses, assuming missing at random (MAR), are biased. By contrast MI, unlike CCA, is valid for all MAR situations and has the potential to use information contained in the incomplete cases and auxiliary variables to reduce bias and/or improve precision. For this reason, MI was preferred over CCA in our real data example.Choice of method for dealing with missing data is crucial for validity of conclusions, and should be based on careful consideration of the reasons for the missing data, missing data patterns and the availability of auxiliary information.},

  abstract = {Vascular cognitive impairment defines alterations in cognition, ranging from subtle deficits to full-blown dementia, attributable to cerebrovascular causes. Often coexisting with Alzheimer's disease, mixed vascular and neurodegenerative dementia has emerged as the leading cause of age-related cognitive impairment. Central to the disease mechanism is the crucial role that cerebral blood vessels play in brain health, not only for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients, but also for the trophic signaling that links inextricably the well being of neurons and glia to that of cerebrovascular cells. This review will examine how vascular damage disrupts these vital homeostatic interactions, focusing on the hemispheric white matter, a region at heightened risk for vascular damage, and on the interplay between vascular factors and Alzheimer's disease. Finally, preventative and therapeutic prospects will be examined, highlighting the importance of midlife vascular risk factor control in the prevention of late-life dementia.},

Article publication delay, which occurs in part due to constraints associated with peer review, can prevent the timely dissemination of critical and actionable data associated with new information on rare diseases or developing health concerns such as Zika virus. Preprint servers are open access online repositories housing preprint research articles that enable authors (1) to make their research immediately and freely available and (2) to receive commentary and peer review prior to journal submission. There is a growing movement of preprint advocates aiming to change the current journal publication and peer review system, proposing that preprints catalyze biomedical discovery, support career advancement, and improve scientific communication. While the number of articles submitted to and hosted by preprint servers are gradually increasing, there has been no simple way to identify biomedical research published in a preprint format, as they are not typically indexed and are only discoverable by directly searching the specific preprint server websites. To address this issue, we created a search engine that quickly compiles preprints from disparate host repositories and provides a one-stop search solution. Additionally, we developed a web application that bolsters the discovery of preprints by enabling each and every word or phrase appearing on any web site to be integrated with articles from preprint servers. This tool, search.bioPreprint, is publicly available at               http://www.hsls.pitt.edu/resources/preprint               .},

  abstract = {\emph{Background/Aims:} Cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) describes individuals whose cognitive functioning falls below normal but who do not meet dementia criteria. An important goal within CIND is to identify subgroups that will predictably progress to Alzheimer disease. CIND with amnestic deficits has been associated with high risk of Alzheimer disease but has until now been investigated on a retrospective basis. In this study a prospectively defined amnestic CIND group was characterized on a detailed neuropsychological test battery and on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures. \emph{Methods:} Amnestic CIND was defined as meeting at least 1 but not all DSM-IV-TR criteria for dementia, scoring {$\geqq$}1 SD below norms on Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall, having a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5 and a Mini-Mental State Exam score {$\geqq$}24. This cross-sectional study compared subjects meeting these criteria (n = 25) to age- and education-matched controls (n = 26). The neuropsychological battery included memory and nonmemory measures that were analyzed as continuous variables and dichotomized into impaired ({$\geqq$}1 SD below controls) versus nonimpaired. MRI scans were evaluated with a global-brain volumetric measure [brain fractional ratio (BFR)] and with visually based medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) ratings. \emph{Results:} Amnestic CIND had neuropsychological impairment in the episodic memory domain and also in nonmemory domains. There were 80\% of CIND subjects with multidomain impairment. The most clear-cut nonmemory impairment was in the verbal ability domain, with 64\% of subjects affected and a moderate effect size (d = 0.7). On MRI, BFR was lower (74.5 {$\pm$} 4.6 vs. 75.5 {$\pm$} 4.4) and MTA higher (72 vs. 38\% with MTA {$\geqq$}1) in CIND than in control subjects. BFR correlated with MTA (r = \textendash 0.45) and with a composite memory score (r = 0.296). \emph{Conclusion:} A prospective amnestic CIND grouping appears to identify individuals with a multidomain pattern of neuropsychological impairment and with both medial temporal lobe and global brain atrophy.},

Study Design and Setting A six-center cross-sectional study with seven reviewers (2 reviewer pairs) assessing the RoB using ROBINS-I (n~=~44 NRS) or ROB-NRSE (n~=~44 NRS). We used Gwet's AC1 statistic to calculate the IRR and ICR. To measure the evaluator burden, we assessed the total time taken to apply the tool and reach a consensus. Results For ROBINS-I, both IRR and ICR for individual domains ranged from poor to substantial agreement. IRR and ICR on overall RoB were poor. The evaluator burden was 48.45~min (95\% CI 45.61 to 51.29). For ROB-NRSE, the IRR and ICR for the majority of domains were poor, while the rest ranged from fair to perfect agreement. IRR and ICR on overall RoB were slight and poor, respectively. The evaluator burden was 36.98~min (95\% CI 34.80 to 39.16). Conclusions We found both tools to have low reliability, although ROBINS-I was slightly higher. Measures to increase agreement between raters (e.g., detailed training, supportive guidance material) may improve reliability and decrease evaluator burden.},

In contrast to some early reports that statins are teratogenic, more recent observational studies have called into question the teratogenic risk of statins. Therefore, whether statins are associated with congenital anomalies or other pregnancy complications remains an important clinical question. This article provides an up-to-date systematic review on the risks of statins in pregnancy. We conducted a literature search to identify relevant English language studies related to statin exposure and pregnancy. Single case reports, animal studies, studies only published in abstract form, and non-English language studies were excluded. A total of 16 clinical studies were included in this systematic review. Although early uncontrolled case series reported congenital anomalies associated with statin use, more recent observational studies did not report an increased risk of congenital anomalies with statin exposure in pregnancy when compared to control groups or the prevalence of congenital anomalies in the general population. Our findings show no clear relationship of congenital anomalies with statin use in pregnancy, and our study supports the findings that statins are probably not teratogenic. However, until more information is available, statins should still be avoided in pregnancy.},

This study examines if and how critical appraisals inform the synthesis and interpretation of evidence in SRs. Methods All SRs published in March\textendash May 2012 in 14 high-ranked medical journals and a sample from the Cochrane library were systematically assessed by two reviewers to determine if and how: critical appraisal was conducted; RoB was summarised at study, domain and review levels; and RoB appraisals informed the synthesis process. Results Of the 59 SRs studied, all except six (90\%) conducted a critical appraisal of the included studies, with most using or adapting existing tools. Almost half of the SRs reported critical appraisal in a manner that did not allow readers to determine which studies included in a review were most robust. RoB assessments were not incorporated into synthesis in one-third (20) of the SRs, with their consideration more likely when reviews focused on randomised controlled trials. Common methods for incorporating critical appraisals into the synthesis process were sensitivity analysis, narrative discussion and exclusion of studies at high RoB. Nearly half of the reviews which investigated multiple outcomes and carried out study-level RoB summaries did not consider the potential for RoB to vary across outcomes. Conclusions The conclusions of the SRs, published in major journals, are frequently uninformed by the critical appraisal process, even when conducted. This may be particularly problematic for SRs of public health topics that often draw on diverse study designs.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Currently systematic reviews focus on diagnosis or effectiveness of treatment. It is the understanding of disease aetiology that underpins medical education, practice and research. Whether an association meets causal criteria is usually assessed qualitatively. However, this can also be examined through evidence synthesis and systematic reviews to evaluate disease causation and mechanisms are much needed. It is important in such a review to specify the questions to be addressed regarding causal criteria such as strength, consistency, temporality, specificity, biological gradient, plausibility and experimental evidence. The next step is to conduct a thorough literature search to identify the relevant studies and to assess them for their quality, particularly in relation to the risk of bias, ascertainment of exposures and ascertainment of outcomes. Data synthesis can then examine if the observed associations in collated studies are consistent, strong and temporal using techniques such as meta-analysis, testing for heterogeneity and meta-regression. Biological plausibility and coherence with existing theories can also be examined systematically through an assessment of the basic scientific literature. Experimental evidence might also be collated and synthesised to determine if removal of a causal agent alters the outcome. Through these steps a systematic review can help to establish whether an association is causal or not.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The {$\epsilon$}4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although there have been numerous studies attempting to elucidate the underlying mechanism for this increased risk, the manner in which apoE4 influences AD onset and progression has yet to be proven. However, prevailing evidence suggests that the differential effects of apoE isoforms on A{$\beta$} aggregation and clearance play the major role in AD pathogenesis. Other potential mechanisms, such as the differential modulation of neurotoxicity and tau phosphorylation by apoE isoforms as well as its role in synaptic plasticity and neuroinflammation, have not been ruled out. Inconsistent results among studies have made it difficult to define whether the APOE {$\epsilon$}4 allele represents a gain of toxic function, a loss of neuroprotective function, or both. Therapeutic strategies based on apoE propose to reduce the toxic effects of apoE4 or to restore the physiological, protective functions of apoE. In addition, modulation of apoE protein levels and lipidation state by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family members and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) may be useful to exploit as future therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Objectives The objective of this review is to identify all preprint platforms with biomedical and medical scope and to compare and contrast the key characteristics and policies of these platforms. Study design and setting Preprint platforms that were launched up to 25 June 2019 and have a biomedical and medical scope according to MEDLINE's journal selection criteria were identified using existing lists, web-based searches and the expertise of both academic and non-academic publication scientists. A data extraction form was developed, pilot tested and used to collect data from each preprint platform's webpage(s). Results A total of 44 preprint platforms were identified as having biomedical and medical scope, 17 (39\%) were hosted by the Open Science Framework preprint infrastructure, 6 (14\%) were provided by F1000 Research (the Open Research Central infrastructure) and 21 (48\%) were other independent preprint platforms. Preprint platforms were either owned by non-profit academic groups, scientific societies or funding organisations (n=28; 64\%), owned/partly owned by for-profit publishers or companies (n=14; 32\%) or owned by individuals/small communities (n=2; 5\%). Twenty-four (55\%) preprint platforms accepted content from all scientific fields although some of these had restrictions relating to funding source, geographical region or an affiliated journal's remit. Thirty-three (75\%) preprint platforms provided details about article screening (basic checks) and 14 (32\%) of these actively involved researchers with context expertise in the screening process. Almost all preprint platforms allow submission to any peer-reviewed journal following publication, have a preservation plan for read access and most have a policy regarding reasons for retraction and the sustainability of the service. Conclusion A large number of preprint platforms exist for use in biomedical and medical sciences, all of which offer researchers an opportunity to rapidly disseminate their research findings onto an open-access public server, subject to scope and eligibility.},

However, little is known about the effect of body mass index and clustering of vascular risk factors on the development of dementia. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between midlife body mass index and clustering of vascular risk factors and subsequent dementia and AD. DESIGN AND SETTING: Participants of the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE) study were derived from random, population-based samples previously studied in a survey carried out in 1972, 1977, 1982, or 1987. After an average follow-up of 21 years, 1449 individuals (73\%) aged 65 to 79 years participated in the reexamination in 1998. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dementia and AD. RESULTS: Obesity at midlife (body mass index{$>$}30 kg/m2) was associated with the risk of dementia and AD even after adjusting for sociodemographic variables (odds ratio [OR], 2.4 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-5.1]). The association was somewhat modified by further adjusting for midlife blood pressure, total cholesterol level, and smoking (OR, 2.1 [95\% CI, 1.0-4.6]) and also for apolipoprotein E genotype and history of vascular disorders (OR, 1.9 [95\% CI, 0.8-4.6]). Midlife obesity, high total cholesterol level, and high systolic blood pressure were all significant risk factors for dementia with ORs of around 2 for each factor, and they increased the risk additively (OR, 6.2 for the combination). CONCLUSIONS: Obesity at midlife is associated with an increased risk of dementia and AD later in life. Clustering of vascular risk factors increases the risk in an additive manner. The role of weight reduction for the prevention of dementia needs to be further investigated.},

These contributions come at a considerable cost: US academic libraries paid \$\$\textbackslash\$1.7\$\$ billion for serial subscriptions in 2008 alone. Library budgets, in contrast, are flat and not able to keep pace with serial price inflation. We have investigated the publishers' value proposition by conducting a comparative study of pre-print papers from two distinct science, technology, and medicine corpora and their final published counterparts. This comparison had two working assumptions: (1) If the publishers' argument is valid, the text of a pre-print paper should vary measurably from its corresponding final published version, and (2) by applying standard similarity measures, we should be able to detect and quantify such differences. Our analysis revealed that the text contents of the scientific papers generally changed very little from their pre-print to final published versions. These findings contribute empirical indicators to discussions of the added value of commercial publishers and therefore should influence libraries' economic decisions regarding access to scholarly publications.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Importance Alzheimer9s disease is the leading cause of disability and healthy life years lost. However, to date, there are no proven causal and modifiable risk factors, or effective interventions. Objective We aimed to identify: a) factors modified by prodromal Alzheimer9s disease pathophysiology and b) causal risk factors for Alzheimer9s disease. We identified factors modified by Alzheimer9s disease using a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) on the Alzheimer9s disease polygenic risk score (PRS) (p{$\leq$}5\texttimes 10-8), stratified by age tertiles. We used two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the causal effects of identified risk factors and correlates on liability for Alzheimer9s disease. Design, setting, and participants 334,968 participants of the UK Biobank aged 39 to 72 years old (111,656 in each tertile) met our eligibility criteria. Exposures Standardized weighted PRS for Alzheimer9s disease at p{$\leq$}5\texttimes 10\textsuperscript{-8}. Main outcomes and measures All available phenotypes in UK Biobank, including data on health and lifestyle, as well as samples from urine, blood and saliva, at the time of analysis. Results Genetic liability for Alzheimer9s disease was associated with red blood cell indices and cognitive measures at all ages. In the middle and older age tertiles, ages 53 and above, higher genetic liability for Alzheimer{${'}$}s disease was adversely associated with medical history (e.g. atherosclerosis, use of cholesterol-lowering medications), physical measures (e.g. body fat measures), blood cell indices (e.g. red blood cell distribution width), cognition (e.g. fluid intelligence score) and lifestyle (e.g. self-reported moderate activity). In follow-up analyses using MR, there was only evidence that education, fluid intelligence score, hip circumference, forced vital capacity, and self-reported moderate physical activity were likely to be causal risk factors for Alzheimer9s disease. Conclusion and relevance Genetic liability for Alzheimer9s disease is associated with over 160 phenotypes, some as early as age 39 years. However, findings from MR analyses imply that most of these associations are likely to be a consequence of prodromal disease or selection, rather than a cause of the disease.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Ezetimibe is the first lipid-lowering drug that inhibits intestinal uptake of dietary and biliary cholesterol without affecting the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients. Following oral administration, ezetimibe is rapidly absorbed and extensively metabolised ({$>$}80\%) to the pharmacologically active ezetimibe-glucuronide. Total ezetimibe (sum of 'parent' ezetimibe plus ezetimibe-glucuronide) concentrations reach a maximum 1-2 hours post-administration, followed by enterohepatic recycling and slow elimination. The estimated terminal half-life of ezetimibe and ezetimibe-glucuronide is approximately 22 hours. Consistent with the elimination half-life of ezetimibe, an approximate 2-fold accumulation is observed upon repeated once-daily administration. The recommended dose of ezetimibe 10 mg/day can be administered in the morning or evening without regard to food. There are no clinically significant effects of age, sex or race on ezetimibe pharmacokinetics and no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment or mild-to-severe renal insufficiency. The major metabolic pathway for ezetimibe consists of glucuronidation of the 4-hydroxyphenyl group by uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase isoenzymes to form ezetimibe-glucuronide in the intestine and liver. Approximately 78\% of the dose is excreted in the faeces predominantly as ezetimibe, with the balance found in the urine mainly as ezetimibe-glucuronide. Overall, ezetimibe has a favourable drug-drug interaction profile, as evidenced by the lack of clinically relevant interactions between ezetimibe and a variety of drugs commonly used in patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Ezetimibe does not have significant effects on plasma levels of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors commonly known as statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin), fibric acid derivatives (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate), digoxin, glipizide, warfarin and triphasic oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel). Concomitant administration of food, antacids, cimetidine or statins had no significant effect on ezetimibe bioavailability. Although coadministration with gemfibrozil and fenofibrate increased the bioavailability of ezetimibe, the clinical significance is thought to be minor considering the relatively flat dose-response curve of ezetimibe and the lack of dose-related increase in adverse events. In contrast, coadministration with the bile acid binding agent colestyramine significantly decreased ezetimibe oral bioavailability (based on area under the plasma concentration-time curve of total ezetimibe). Hence, ezetimibe and colestyramine should be administered several hours apart to avoid attenuating the efficacy of ezetimibe. Finally, higher ezetimibe exposures were observed in patients receiving concomitant ciclosporin, and ezetimibe caused a small but statistically significant effect on plasma levels of ciclosporin. Because treatment experience in patients receiving ciclosporin is limited, physicians are advised to exercise caution when initiating ezetimibe in the setting of ciclosporin coadministration, and to carefully monitor ciclosporin levels.},

OBJECTIVE: To identify common characteristics of diseases that GPs may misdiagnose. METHODS: Systematic search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for primary research on diagnostic error/delay in primary care. Papers on system errors, patient delay, case reports, reviews, opinion pieces, studies not based on actual cases and studies not using a systematic sample were excluded from the review. Twenty-one papers were included. All papers were assessed for quality using the GRADE system. Common features were identified across diseases and presentations that made diagnosis difficult and led to error/delay. RESULTS: Most studies were retrospective cohorts of patients recruited in hospital and collected data from patient interviews and/or hospital records, resulting in incomplete and potentially biased information. It was usually not possible to determine preventability of the delay. Some conditions were extremely rare, suggesting a specialist research interest rather than an increased rate of misdiagnosis. Conditions investigated were malignancies, myocardial infarction, meningitis, dementia, iron deficiency anaemia, asthma, tremor in the elderly and HIV. Common features of difficulty were atypical presentations, non-specific presentations, very low prevalence, the presence of co-morbidity and perceptual features and could be missed. CONCLUSIONS: Misdiagnosis in primary care covers a wide range of conditions that may be related in the manner in which they present. The challenge is to identify ways of supporting the diagnostic process in potentially difficult presentations.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous risk factors for dementia are well established, though the causal nature of these associations remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review Mendelian randomization (MR) studies investigating causal relationships between risk factors and global cognitive function or dementia. METHODS: We searched five databases from inception to February 2017 and conducted citation searches including MR studies investigating the association between any risk factor and global cognitive function, all-cause dementia or dementia subtypes. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts, full-texts, and study quality. RESULTS: We included 18 MR studies investigating education, lifestyle factors, cardiovascular factors and related biomarkers, diabetes related and other endocrine factors, and telomere length. Studies were of predominantly good quality, however eight received low ratings for sample size and statistical power. The most convincing causal evidence was found for an association of shorter telomeres with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Causal evidence was weaker for smoking quantity, vitamin D, homocysteine, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, insulin sensitivity, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Well-replicated associations were not present for most exposures and we cannot fully discount survival and diagnostic bias, or the potential for pleiotropic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic evidence supported a causal association between telomere length and AD, whereas limited evidence for other risk factors was largely inconclusive with tentative evidence for smoking quantity, vitamin D, homocysteine, and selected metabolic markers. The lack of stronger evidence for other risk factors may reflect insufficient statistical power. Larger well-designed MR studies would therefore help establish the causal status of these dementia risk factors.},

METHODS: We searched Medline, PsycINFO and Embase for studies assessing prevalent or incident stroke versus a no-stroke comparison group and the risk of all-cause dementia. Random effects meta-analysis was used to pool adjusted estimates across studies and meta-regression was used to investigate potential effect modifiers. RESULTS: We identified 36 studies of prevalent stroke (1.9 million participants) and 12 studies of incident stroke (1.3 million participants). For prevalent stroke, the pooled hazard ratio for all-cause dementia was 1.69 (95\% CI: 1.49\textendash 1.92; p{$<$}0.00001; I2 = 87\%). For incident stroke, the pooled risk ratio was 2.18 (95\% CI: 1.90\textendash 2.50; p{$<$}0.00001; I2 = 88\%). Study characteristics did not modify these associations, with the exception of sex which explained 50.2\% of between-study heterogeneity for prevalent stroke. DISCUSSION: Stroke is a strong, independent, and potentially modifiable risk factor for all-cause dementia.},

  abstract = {Background. The standard approach for survival analysis of the elderly population is to define the survival time as the elapsed time from entry into the study until death, and to adjust by age using stratification and regression procedures. However, the interest is in the study of the aging process and the risk factors related to it, not in the use of timeon-study as the'time scale. Here, we present methods to use age as the time scale and compare inferences and interpretations with those obtained using the standard approach. Methods. A total of 1,315 individuals aged 65 years or older from the city of Barcelona, Spain, were interviewed in 1986 (baseline). The vital status of the cohort was assessed in October 1994. To illustrate the usefulness of age as time scale (alternative approach) instead of tjme-on-study in the survival analysis of the elderly population, both methods were used to assess the relationship between baseline functional capacity and mortality. Results. Using the alternative approach, we observed that 50\% of the sample died at age 80.6 years; this information could not be estimated with the standard approach. Using age as a covariate in the standard analysis with time-onstudy as the time scale and using age as the time scale in the alternative analysis, the association of functional capacity at baseline and mortality was of similar magnitude under both analyses. Nevertheless, using the alternative approach, relative risks were slightly lower, and the adjustment by age was tight and was not subject to the inherent assumptions in regression models of the functional relationship of independent variables with outcome. We illustrated the methods with fixed covariates (i.e., gender) and baseline values of time-dependent covariates (i.e., functional capacity), but we discussed the extension of our methods for the analysis of time-dependent covariates measured at several visits in a cohort study. Methods proposed here are easily implemented with widely available statistical software packages. Conclusions. Although the use of standard survival analysis generally produces correct estimates, the use of age as time scale is deemed more appropriate for survival analysis of the elderly: Inferences are easier to interpret and final models are simpler. We therefore recommend the use of age as time scale for survival analysis of the elderly population.},

Case\textendash control studies are generally considered to have greater risk of bias than cohort studies, but we lack evidence of differences in effect estimates between the 2 study types. We aimed to compare estimates between cohort and case\textendash control studies in meta-analyses of observational studies of therapeutic interventions by using a meta-epidemiological study. Methods We used a random sample of meta-analyses of therapeutic interventions published in 2013 that included both cohort and case\textendash control studies assessing a binary outcome. For each meta-analysis, the ratio of estimates (RE) was calculated by comparing the estimate in case\textendash control studies to that in cohort studies. Then, we used random-effects meta-analysis to estimate a combined RE across meta-analyses. An RE {$<$} 1 indicated that case\textendash control studies yielded larger estimates than cohort studies. Results The final analysis included 23 meta-analyses: 138 cohort and 133 case\textendash control studies. Treatment effect estimates did not significantly differ between case\textendash control and cohort studies (combined RE 0.97 [95\% CI 0.86\textendash 1.09]). Heterogeneity was low, with between\textendash meta-analysis variance {$\tau$}2 = 0.0049. Estimates did not differ between case\textendash control and prospective or retrospective cohort studies (RE = 1.05 [95\% CI 0.96\textendash 1.15] and RE = 0.99 [95\% CI, 0.83\textendash 1.19], respectively). Sensitivity analysis of studies reporting adjusted estimates also revealed no significant difference (RE = 1.03 [95\% CI 0.91\textendash 1.16]). Heterogeneity was also low for these analyses. Conclusion We found no significant difference in treatment effect estimates between case\textendash control and cohort studies assessing therapeutic interventions.},

Design Three meta-analyses: 164 short term randomised placebo controlled trials of six statins and LDL cholesterol reduction; 58 randomised trials of cholesterol lowering by any means and IHD events; and nine cohort studies and the same 58 trials on stoke. Main outcome measures Reductions in LDL cholesterol according to statin and dose; reduction in IHD events and stroke for a specified reduction in LDL cholesterol. Results Reductions in LDL cholesterol (in the 164 trials) were 2.8 mmol/l (60\%) with rosuvastatin 80 mg/day, 2.6 mmol/l (55\%) with atorvastatin 80 mg/day, 1.8 mmol/l (40\%) with atorvastatin 10 mg/day, lovastatin 40 mg/day, simvastatin 40 mg/day, or rosuvastatin 5 mg/day, all from pretreatment concentrations of 4.8 mmol/l. Pravastatin and fluvastatin achieved smaller reductions. In the 58 trials, for an LDL cholesterol reduction of 1.0 mmol/l the risk of IHD events was reduced by 11\% in the first year of treatment, 24\% in the second year, 33\% in years three to five, and by 36\% thereafter (P {$<$} 0.001 for trend). IHD events were reduced by 20\%, 31\%, and 51\% in trials grouped by LDL cholesterol reduction (means 0.5 mmol/l, 1.0 mmol/l, and 1.6 mmol/l) after results from first two years of treatment were excluded (P {$<$} 0.001 for trend). After several years a reduction of 1.8 mmol/l would reduce IHD events by an estimated 61\%. Results from the same 58 trials, corroborated by results from the nine cohort studies, show that lowering LDL cholesterol decreases all stroke by 10\% for a 1 mmol/l reduction and 17\% for a 1.8 mmol/l reduction. Estimates allow for the fact that trials tended to recruit people with vascular disease, among whom the effect of LDL cholesterol reduction on stroke is greater because of their higher risk of thromboembolic stroke (rather than haemorrhagic stroke) compared with people in the general population. Conclusions Statins can lower LDL cholesterol concentration by an average of 1.8 mmol/l which reduces the risk of IHD events by about 60\% and stroke by 17\%.},

  abstract = {Triangulation is the practice of obtaining more reliable answers to research questions through integrating results from several different approaches, where each approach has different key sources of potential bias that are unrelated to each other. With respect to causal questions in aetiological epidemiology, if the results of different approaches all point to the same conclusion, this strengthens confidence in the finding. This is particularly the case when the key sources of bias of some of the approaches would predict that findings would point in opposite directions if they were due to such biases. Where there are inconsistencies, understanding the key sources of bias of each approach can help to identify what further research is required to address the causal question. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how triangulation might be used to improve causal inference in aetiological epidemiology. We propose a minimum set of criteria for use in triangulation in aetiological epidemiology, summarize the key sources of bias of several approaches and describe how these might be integrated within a triangulation framework. We emphasize the importance of being explicit about the expected direction of bias within each approach, whenever this is possible, and seeking to identify approaches that would be expected to bias the true causal effect in different directions. We also note the importance, when comparing results, of taking account of differences in the duration and timing of exposures. We provide three examples to illustrate these points.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES To examine the age specific risk of Alzheimer's disease according to sex, and to explore the role of education in a cohort of elderly community residents aged 65 years and older. METHODS A community based cohort of elderly people was studied longitudinally for 5 years for the development of dementia. Dementia diagnoses were made according to the DSM III R criteria and Alzheimer's disease was assessed using the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. Among the 3675 non-demented subjects initially included in the cohort, 2881 participated in the follow up. Hazard ratios of dementia were estimated using a Cox model with delayed entry in which the time scale is the age of the subjects. RESULTS During the 5 year follow up, 190 incident cases of dementia, including 140 cases of Alzheimer's disease were identified. The incidence rates of Alzheimer's disease were 0.8/100 person-years in men and 1.4/100 person-years in women. However, the incidence was higher in men than in women before the age of 80 and higher in women than in men after this age. A significant interaction between sex and age was found. The hazard ratio of Alzheimer's disease in women compared with men was estimated to be 0.8 at 75 years and 1.7 at 85 years. The risks of dementia and Alzheimer's disease were associated with a lower educational attainment (hazard ratio=1.8, p{$<$}0.001). The increased risk of Alzheimer's disease in women was not changed after adjustment for education. CONCLUSION Women have a higher risk of developing dementia after the age of 80 than men. Low educational attainment is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's disease. However, the increased risk in women is not explained by a lower educational level.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine the association of serum total cholesterol (TC) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and subsequent incidence of dementia and Alzheimer disease (AD) in a population-based cohort study. METHODS: A cohort of cognitively intact persons, aged 65 and older, was randomly selected from Group Health Cooperative (GHC), a large health maintenance organization, and was assessed biennially for dementia. Premorbid levels of TC and HDL were obtained from a computerized clinical laboratory database at GHC. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR, 95\% CI) for dementia and AD associated with quartiles of TC and HDL levels. RESULTS: Of the 2,356 eligible participants, 2,141 had at least one serum TC measure prior to the initial enrollment. Using the lowest TC quartiles as the reference group, the HR in the highest TC quartiles was not significantly elevated for dementia (1.16, 0.81 to 1.67) or for AD (1.00, 0.61 to 1.62) after adjusting for age, sex, education, baseline cognition, vascular comorbidities, body mass index, and lipid-lowering agent use. Serum HDL showed a similar lack of significant association with risk of dementia or AD. Models that included the presence of one or more APOE-epsilon4 alleles showed a typical association of epsilon4 with AD risk. This association was not materially modified by inclusion of TC level. CONCLUSION: The data do not support an association between serum total cholesterol or high density lipoprotein in late life and subsequent risk of dementia or Alzheimer disease (AD). The increased risk of AD with APOE-epsilon4 is probably not mediated by serum total cholesterol levels.},

Development of atherosclerotic lesions probably requires low-density lipoprotein, a particle that carries cholesterol through the blood. Other risk factors for atherosclerosis and its thrombotic complications include hypertension, cigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus. Increasing evidence also points to a role of the immune system, as emerging risk factors include inflammation and clonal haematopoiesis. Studies of the cell and molecular biology of atherogenesis have provided considerable insight into the mechanisms that link all these risk factors to atheroma development and the clinical manifestations of this disease. An array of diagnostic techniques, both invasive (such as selective coronary arteriography) and~noninvasive (such as blood biomarkers, stress testing, CT and nuclear scanning), permit assessment of cardiovascular disease risk and targeting of therapies. An expanding armamentarium of therapies that can modify risk factors and confer clinical benefit is available; however, we face considerable challenge in providing equitable access to these treatments and in maximizing adherence. Yet, the clinical application of the fruits of research has advanced preventive strategies, enhanced clinical outcomes in affected individuals, and improved their quality of life. Rapidly accelerating knowledge and continued research promise to provide further progress in combating this common chronic disease.},

Many techniques have been developed for study design and analysis to identify and eliminate such errors. Such problems are not expected to compromise experimental studies, where careful standardization of conditions (for laboratory work) and randomization (for population studies) should, if applied properly, eliminate most such non-causal associations. We argue, however, that a routine precaution taken in the design of biological laboratory experiments\textemdash the use of ``negative controls''\textemdash is designed to detect both suspected and unsuspected sources of spurious causal inference. In epidemiology, analogous negative controls help to identify and resolve confounding as well as other sources of error, including recall bias or analytic flaws. We distinguish two types of negative controls (exposure controls and outcome controls), describe examples of each type from the epidemiologic literature, and identify the conditions for the use of such negative controls to detect confounding. We conclude that negative controls should be more commonly employed in observational studies, and that additional work is needed to specify the conditions under which negative controls will be sensitive detectors of other sources of error in observational studies.},

The schemes appear to have been effective in boosting dementia diagnosis rates, but their unintended effects are unknown. Aim To identify and quantify unintended consequences associated with the DES18 and DIS schemes. Design and setting A retrospective cohort quantitative study of 7079 English primary care practices. Method Potential unintended effects of financial incentive schemes, both positive and negative, were identified from a literature review. A practice-level dataset covering the period 2006/2007 to 2015/2016 was constructed. Difference-in-differences analysis was employed to test the effects of the incentive schemes on quality measures from the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF); and four measures of patient experience from the GP Patient Survey (GPPS): patient-centred care, access to care, continuity of care, and the doctor\textendash patient relationship. The researchers controlled for effects of the contemporaneous hospital incentive scheme for dementia and for practice characteristics. Results National practice participation rates in DES18 and DIS were 98.5\% and 76\% respectively. Both schemes were associated not only with a positive impact on QOF quality outcomes, but also with negative impacts on some patient experience indicators. Conclusion The primary care incentive schemes for dementia appear to have enhanced QOF performance for the dementia review, and have had beneficial spillover effects on QOF performance in other clinical areas. However, the schemes may have had negative impacts on several aspects of patient experience.},

Including grey literature can broaden the scope to more relevant studies, thereby providing a more complete view of available evidence. Searching for grey literature can be challenging despite greater access through the Internet, search engines and online bibliographic databases. There are a number of publications that list sources for finding grey literature in systematic reviews. However, there is scant information about how searches for grey literature are executed and how it is included in the review process. This level of detail is important to ensure that reviews follow explicit methodology to be systematic, transparent and reproducible. The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed account of one systematic review team's experience in searching for grey literature and including it throughout the review. We provide a brief overview of grey literature before describing our search and review approach. We also discuss the benefits and challenges of including grey literature in our systematic review, as well as the strengths and limitations to our approach. Detailed information about incorporating grey literature in reviews is important in advancing methodology as review teams adapt and build upon the approaches described.

This study examined the relationship between transferrin saturation (TS) and cholesterol to see if both are necessary to increase the risk for the subsequent development of AD. METHODS: We analyzed data from US adults (ages 40-74 years at baseline) followed from baseline in 1971-1974 to 1992 (n=6,558) in the cohort study, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Followup Study (NHEFS). RESULTS: The unadjusted relative risk of developing AD when both TS and cholesterol were at the 75th percentile was 3.19 (95\% CI, 1.31-7.75). In adjusted models when only one marker was elevated, there was no significant increased risk for AD. The risk of AD increased as both markers increased. Even at the 85th percentile, individuals had no significant risk of AD when only having elevated cholesterol ({$>$}280 mg/dl) but not elevated TS (39.6\%). Findings were similar for individuals with elevated TS but not elevated cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based cohort, the risk of developing AD when one has both elevated cholesterol and elevated TS is much larger than the risk associated with elevation of either of these factors alone.},

  abstract = {Objectives Ovarian cancer is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage when five-year relative survival is {$<$}50\%. Therefore, strategies to improve survival are required. Studies suggest associations between common chronic disease medications such as metformin, statins, beta-blockers, aspirin and non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NA-NSAIDs) and improved cancer survival. We aimed to review the evidence for a possible relation between these medications and survival among women with ovarian cancer. Methods We conducted four systematic reviews and evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies. Where possible, we calculated pooled hazard ratios (pHR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI), excluding studies considered to have the potential for immortal time bias (ITB) which, in practice, was the major source of bias. Results We identified 36 studies evaluating one or more of the medications (metformin n~=~8, statins n~=~12, beta-blockers n~=~11, aspirin and/or NA-NSAIDs n~=~9). We rated 21 studies as ITB-free. The meta-analysis of the ITB-free studies suggested improved survival in statin users compared to non-users (pHR: 0.76, 95\%CI: 0.68\textendash 0.85), but no overall survival benefit associated with use of metformin, beta-blockers, aspirin or NA-NSAIDs. The pooled result of two studies did, however, suggest a possible association between perioperative beta-blocker use and improved survival. Studies considered to have potential ITB were more likely to report survival benefits associated with these medications. Conclusion Statin use is associated with better ovarian cancer survival but further study, preferably a clinical trial, is required. There are insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding metformin, beta-blockers, aspirin and NA-NSAIDs.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of adult-onset dementia is characterized by a progressive decline of cognitive functions accompanied by behavioral manifestations. The main class of drugs currently used for the treatment of AD are acetylcholinesterase/cholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-Is). The first ChE-I licensed for symptomatic treatment of AD was tacrine. The ChE-Is currently available in the market are donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine as tacrine is no longer in use, due to its hepatotoxicity. According to mechanism of action the ChE-Is are classified as short-acting or reversible agents such as tacrine, donepezil, and galantamine, as intermediate-acting or pseudo-irreversible agent such as rivastigmine. Overall, the efficacy of the three ChE-Is available in the market is similar and the benefit of administration of these compounds is mild and may not be clinically significant. Due to gastrointestinal side effects of these drugs, medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical delivery studies have investigated solutions to improve the pharmacological activity of these compounds. In spite of the limited activity of ChE-Is, waiting for more effective approaches, these drugs still represent a pharmacotherapeutic resource for the treatment of AD. Other approaches in which ChE-Is were investigated is in their use in combination with other classes of drugs such as cholinergic precursors, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and antioxidant agents. After many years from the introduction in therapy of ChE-Is, the combination with other classes of drugs may represent the chance for a renewed interest of ChE-Is in the treatment of adult-onset dementia disorders.},

This study profiles the completeness, consistency and representativeness of routinely collected ethnicity data in both primary care and hospital settings. METHODS: Completeness and consistency of ethnicity recording was examined in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), and the ethnic breakdown of the CPRD was compared with that of the 2011 UK censuses. RESULTS: 27.1\% of all patients in the CPRD (1990-2012) have ethnicity recorded. This proportion rises to 78.3\% for patients registered since April 2006. The ethnic breakdown of the CPRD is comparable to the UK censuses. 79.4\% of HES inpatients, 46.8\% of outpatients and 26.8\% of A\&E patients had their ethnicity recorded. Amongst those with ethnicity recorded on {$>$}1 occasion, consistency was over 90\% in all data sets except for HES inpatients. Combining CPRD and HES increased completeness to 97\%, with 85\% of patients having the same ethnicity recorded in both databases. CONCLUSIONS: Using CPRD ethnicity from 2006 onwards maximizes completeness and comparability with the UK population. High concordance within and across NHS sources suggests these data are of high value when examining the continuum of care. Poor completeness and consistency of A\&E and outpatient data render these sources unreliable.},

  abstract = {Population health researchers from different fields often address similar substantive questions but rely on different study designs, reflecting their home disciplines. This is especially true in studies involving causal inference, for which semantic and substantive differences inhibit interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration. In this paper, we group nonrandomized study designs into two categories: those that use confounder-control (such as regression adjustment or propensity score matching) and those that rely on an instrument (such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, or differences-in-differences approaches). Using the Shadish, Cook, and Campbell framework for evaluating threats to validity, we contrast the assumptions, strengths, and limitations of these two approaches and illustrate differences with examples from the literature on education and health. Across disciplines, all methods to test a hypothesized causal relationship involve unverifiable assumptions, and rarely is there clear justification for exclusive reliance on one method. Each method entails trade-offs between statistical power, internal validity, measurement quality, and generalizability. The choice between confounder-control and instrument-based methods should be guided by these tradeoffs and consideration of the most important limitations of previous work in the area. Our goals are to foster common understanding of the methods available for causal inference in population health research and the tradeoffs between them; to encourage researchers to objectively evaluate what can be learned from methods outside one's home discipline; and to facilitate the selection of methods that best answer the investigator's scientific questions.},

We set out to examine whether exclusion of grey literature, compared with its inclusion in meta-analysis, provides different estimates of the effectiveness of interventions assessed in randomised trials. METHODS: From a random sample of 135 meta-analyses, we identified and retrieved 33 publications that included both grey and published primary studies. The 33 publications contributed 41 separate meta-analyses from several disease areas. General characteristics of the meta-analyses and associated studies and outcome data at the trial level were collected. We explored the effects of the inclusion of grey literature on the quantitative results using logistic-regression analyses. FINDINGS: 33\% of the meta-analyses were found to include some form of grey literature. The grey literature, when included, accounts for between 4.5\% and 75\% of the studies in a meta-analysis. On average, published work, compared with grey literature, yielded significantly larger estimates of the intervention effect by 15\% (ratio of odds ratios=1.15 [95\% CI 1.04-1.28]). Excluding abstracts from the analysis further compounded the exaggeration (1.33 [1.10-1.60]). INTERPRETATION: The exclusion of grey literature from meta-analyses can lead to exaggerated estimates of intervention effectiveness. In general, meta-analysts should attempt to identify, retrieve, and include all reports, grey and published, that meet predefined inclusion criteria.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and then updated in 2009. Vascular risk factors including high cholesterol levels increase the risk of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and of vascular dementia. Some observational studies have suggested an association between statin use and lowered incidence of dementia. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins for the prevention of dementia in people at risk of dementia due to their age and to determine whether the efficacy and safety of statins for this purpose depends on cholesterol level, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype or cognitive level. SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS (the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) Portal on 11 November 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in which statins were administered for at least 12 months to people at risk of dementia. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. MAIN RESULTS: We included two trials with 26,340 participants aged 40 to 82 years of whom 11,610 were aged 70 or older. All participants had a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease. The studies used different statins (simvastatin and pravastatin). Mean follow-up was 3.2 years in one study and five years in one study. The risk of bias was low. Only one study reported on the incidence of dementia (20,536 participants, 31 cases in each group; odds ratio (OR) 1.00, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 1.65, moderate quality evidence, downgraded due to imprecision). Both studies assessed cognitive function, but at different times using different scales, so we judged the results unsuitable for a meta-analysis. There were no differences between statin and placebo groups on five different cognitive tests (high quality evidence). Rates of treatment discontinuation due to non-fatal adverse events were less than 5\% in both studies and there was no difference between statin and placebo groups in the risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (26,340 participants, 2 studies, OR 0.94, 95\% CI 0.83 to 1.05). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is good evidence that statins given in late life to people at risk of vascular disease do not prevent cognitive decline or dementia. Biologically, it seems feasible that statins could prevent dementia due to their role in cholesterol reduction and initial evidence from observational studies was very promising. However, indication bias may have been a factor in these studies and the evidence from subsequent RCTs has been negative. There were limitations in the included studies involving the cognitive assessments used and the inclusion of participants at moderate to high vascular risk only.},

Randomized clinical trials may also be impractical, for example when the outcome of interest is so rare or so long term that appropriately sized studies would be too expensive. In addition, RCTs require clinical equipoise, and withholding established treatments may be considered unethical even if evidence for the effects of these treatments is limited. Finally, RCTs may be underway but not ready for reporting for some years.In such situations, evidence from nonrandomized studies of interventions, such as cohort studies and case-control studies, can be essential in assessing the effects of an intervention. Moreover, the increasing availability of large electronic health record data sets is leading to unprecedented opportunities to compare the effects of health care interventions being used in routine practice. For example, a recent study published in JAMA Cardiology examined the safety and long-term outcoms of multiple arterial grafting vs standard treatment. Randomized clinical trials are often unable to examine rare and long-term outcomes, and so data on more than 20 000 patients from the Cardiac Services British Columbia registry were analyzed.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of the study is to assess the validity of codes or algorithms used to identify dementia in UK electronic health record (EHR) primary care and hospitalisation databases. Methods Relevant studies were identified by searching the MEDLINE/EMBASE databases from inception to June 2018, hand-searching reference lists, and consulting experts. The search strategy included synonyms for ``Dementia'', ``Europe'', and ``EHR''. Studies were included if they validated dementia diagnoses in UK primary care or hospitalisation databases, irrespective of validation method used. The Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess risk of bias. Results From 1469 unique records, 14 relevant studies were included. Thirteen validated individual diagnoses against a reference standard, reporting high estimates of validity. Most reported only the positive predictive value (PPV), with estimates ranging between 0.09 and 1.0 and 0.62 and 0.85 in primary care and hospitalisation databases, respectively. One study performed a rate comparison, indicating good generalisability of dementia diagnoses in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database to the UK population. Studies were of low methodological quality. As studies were not comparable, no summary validity estimates were produced. Conclusion While heterogenous across studies, reported validity estimates were generally high. However, the credibility of these estimates is limited by the methodological quality of studies, primarily resulting from insufficient blinding of researchers interpreting the reference test. Inadequate reporting, particularly of the specific codes validated, hindered comparison of estimates across studies. Future validation studies should make use of more robust reference tests, follow established reporting guidelines, and calculate all measures of validity.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine whether medRxiv data availability statements describe open or closed data - that is, whether the data used in the study is openly available without restriction - and to examine if this changes on publication based on journal data sharing policy. Additionally, to examine whether data availability statements are sufficient to capture code availability declarations. Design Observational study, following a pre-registered protocol, of preprints posted on the medRxiv repository between 25th June 2019 and 1st May 2020 and their published counterparts. Main outcome measures Distribution of preprinted data availability statements across eight categories, determined by a prespecified classification system. Change in the percentage of data availability statements describing open data between the preprinted and published versions of the same record, stratified by journal sharing policy. Number of code availability declarations reported in the full-text preprint which were not captured in the corresponding data availability statement. Results 4101 medRxiv preprints were included in our sample, of which 911 (22.2\%) were categorized as describing open data, 3027 (73.8\%) as describing closed data, 163 (4.0\%) as not applicable (e.g. editorial, protocol). 379 (9.2\%) preprints were subsequently published, and of these published articles, only 159 (42.0\%) contained a data availability statement. Similar to the preprint stage, most published data availability statements described closed data (59 (37.1\%) open, 96 (60.4\%) closed, 4 (2.5\%) not applicable). Of the 151 records eligible for the comparison between preprinted and published stages, 57 (37.7\%) were published in journals which mandated open data sharing. Data availability statements more frequently described open data on publication when the journal mandated data sharing (open at preprint: 33.3\%, open at publication: 61.4\%) compared to when the journal did not mandate data sharing (open at preprint: 20.2\%, open at publication: 22.3\%). Conclusion Requiring that authors submit a data availability statement is a good first step, but is insufficient to ensure data availability. Strict editorial policies that require data sharing (where appropriate) as a condition of publication appear to be effective in making research data available. We would strongly encourage all journal editors to examine whether their data availability policies are sufficiently stringent and consistently enforced.},

  abstract = {2 Abstract Background There is some evidence that circulating blood lipids play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. These modifiable risk factors could be targeted by existing lipid-regulating agents, including statins, for dementia prevention. Here, we test the association between lipid-regulating agents and incidence of dementia and related conditions in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), an United Kingdom-based electronic health record database. Methods A retrospective cohort study was performed using routinely collected CPRD data (January 1995 and March 2016). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models, allowing for a time-varying treatment indicator, were used to estimate the association between seven lipid-regulating drug classes (vs. no drug) and five dementia outcomes (all-cause, vascular and other dementias, and probable and possible Alzheimer's disease). Results We analyzed 1,684,564 participants with a total follow-up of 10,835,685 patient-years (median: 5.9 years (IQR:2.7-9.7)). We found little evidence that lipid-regulating agents were associated with incidence of Alzheimer's disease (probable HR:0.98, 95\%CI:0.94-1.01; possible HR:0.97, 95\%CI:0.93-1.01), but there was evidence of an increased risk of all-cause (HR:1.17, 95\%CI:1.14-1.19), vascular (HR:1.81, 95\%CI:1.73-1.89) and other dementias (HR:1.19, 95\%CI:1.15-1.24). Evidence from a number of control outcomes indicated the presence of substantial residual confounding by indication (ischaemic heart disease HR: 1.62, 95\%CI: 1.59-1.64; backpain HR: 1.04, 95\%CI: 1.03-1.05; and Type 2 diabetes HR: 1.50, 95\%CI: 1.48-1.51). Conclusion Lipid-regulating agents were not associated with reduced Alzheimer's disease risk. There was some evidence of an increased the risk of all-cause, vascular and other dementias, likely due to residual confounding by indication. Key messagesA large cohort of patients from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) electronic health record database was assembled to examine the association of lipid-regulating agents, such as statins, with dementia outcomes.There was little evidence that lipid-regulating agents were associated with Alzheimer's disease, but there was some evidence for a harmful association with all-cause, vascular and other dementias. In all cases, the estimated associations were driven by the any statin subgroup, which comprised most participants in our cohort.Evidence from the control outcome analyses indicated strong residual confounding by indication, mostly likely related to vascular factors.},

The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

Study Design and Setting Cross-sectional study and survey on all new Cochrane intervention reviews published between January 1, 2016 and January 31,~2017. Results The cross-sectional study found that reviewers had contacted or had tried to contact studies to obtain additional information in 73.4\% (234/319) of reviews but reported poorly on the methods, outcomes, and consequences of this procedure. Most eligible studies in the reviews were poorly reported, but few reviewers 21.2\% (65/306) reported that they had contacted these studies. The survey showed that risk of bias scores, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation scores, the summary primary or secondary outcomes, and the summary effect size of the primary outcome of the review were changed as a consequence of contacting of authors. Thirty-five of one hundred and thirty (26.9\%) reviews scored opposite outcomes for the same question in the cross-sectional study compared with the survey. Conclusions Our findings on contacting of authors by Cochrane reviewers showed relevant shortcomings in the current standards and transparency of Cochrane reviews. These shortcomings can compromise the validity and reproducibility of these reviews and affect a wide audience.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the longitudinal association between plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride levels and incident dementia. METHODS: Neuropsychiatric, anthropometric, laboratory, and other assessments were conducted for 392 participants of a 1901 to 1902 birth cohort first examined at age 70. Follow-up examinations were at ages 75, 79, 81, 83, 85, and 88. Information on those lost to follow-up was collected from case records, hospital linkage system, and death certificates. Cox proportional hazards regression examined lipid levels at ages 70, 75, and 79 and incident dementia between ages 70 and 88. RESULTS: Increasing cholesterol levels (per mmol/L) at ages 70 (hazard ratio [HR] 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.61 to 0.96, p = 0.02), 75 (HR 0.70, CI: 0.52 to 0.93, p = 0.01), and 79 (HR 0.73, CI: 0.55 to 0.98, p = 0.04) were associated with a reduced risk of dementia between ages 79 and 88. Examination of cholesterol levels in quartiles showed that the risk reduction was apparent only among the highest quartile at ages 70 (8.03 to 11.44 mmol/L [311 to 442 mg/dL]; HR 0.31, CI: 0.11 to 0.85, p = 0.03), 75 (7.03 to 9.29 mmol/L [272 to 359 mg/dL]; HR 0.20, CI: 0.05 to 0.75, p = 0.02), and 79 (6.82 to 9.10 mmol/L [264 to 352 mg/dL]; HR 0.45, CI: 0.17 to 1.23, p = 0.12). Triglyceride levels were not associated with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: High cholesterol in late life was associated with decreased dementia risk, which is in contrast to previous studies suggesting high cholesterol in mid-life is a risk factor for later dementia. The conflicting results may be explained by the timing of the cholesterol measurements in relationship to age and the clinical onset of dementia.},

However, the relationship between cholesterol and dementia at the population level is less clear and may vary over the lifespan. METHODS: The Prospective Population Study of Women, consisting of 1,462 women without dementia aged 38-60 years, was initiated in 1968-1969 in Gothenburg, Sweden. Follow-ups were conducted in 1974-1975, 1980-1981, 1992-1993, and 2000-2001. All-cause dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-III-R criteria and AD according to National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria. Cox proportional hazards regression examined baseline, time-dependent, and change in cholesterol levels in relation to incident dementia and AD among all participants. Analyses were repeated among participants who survived to the age of 70 years or older and participated in the 2000-2001 examination. RESULTS: Higher cholesterol level in 1968 was not associated with an increased risk of AD (highest vs lowest quartile: hazard ratio [HR] 2.82, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.94-8.43) among those who survived to and participated in the 2000-2001 examination. While there was no association between cholesterol level and dementia when considering all participants over 32 years, a time-dependent decrease in cholesterol over the follow-up was associated with an increased risk of dementia (HR 2.35, 95\% CI 1.22-4.58). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that midlife cholesterol level is not associated with an increased risk of AD. However, there may be a slight risk among those surviving to an age at risk for dementia. Declining cholesterol levels from midlife to late life may better predict AD risk than levels obtained at one timepoint prior to dementia onset. Analytic strategies examining this and other risk factors across the lifespan may affect interpretation of results.},

  abstract = {Objective The objective of the study is to assess the interrater reliability (IRR) and usability of the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2). Study Design and Setting This is a cross-sectional study. Four raters independently applied RoB 2 on the primary outcome of a random sample of individually randomized parallel-group trials (randomized controlled trials (RCTs)). We calculated the Fleiss' kappa for multiple raters, the time needed to complete the tool, and discussed the application of RoB 2 to identify difficulties and reasons for disagreement. Results A total of 70 outcomes from 70 RCTs were included. IRR was slight for overall judgment (IRR 0.16, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.08\textendash 0.24); individual domain analysis gave IRR as moderate for ``randomization process'' (IRR 0.45, 95\% CI 0.37\textendash 0.53), slight for ``deviations from intended intervention'' for RCTs assessing the effect of the assignment to an intervention (IRR 0.04, 95\% CI -0.06 to 0.14), fair for those assessing the effect of adhering (IRR 0.21, 95\% CI 0.11\textendash 0.31), and fair for the other domains, ranging from 0.22 (95\% CI 0.14\textendash 0.30) for ``missing outcome data'' to 0.30 (95\% CI 0.22\textendash 0.38) for ``selection of reported results''. Mean time to apply the tool was 28~minutes (standard deviation 13.4) per study outcome. The main difficulties were due to poor knowledge of the subject matter of primary studies, new terminology, different approaches for some domains compared with the previous tool, and way of formulating signaling questions. Conclusions RoB 2 is a detailed and comprehensive tool but difficult and demanding, even for raters with substantial expertise in systematic reviews. Calibration exercises and intensive training are needed before its application, to improve reliability.},

  abstract = {Objective Hospitalizations of people with dementia (PWD) are often accompanied by complications or functional loss and can lead to adverse outcomes. Unsystematic findings suggest an influence of comorbidities on the extent of differences in the length of hospital stay (LOS). This systematic review aimed to identify and evaluate all studies reporting LOS in PWD as compared to PwoD in general hospitals. Methods A systematic review of observational studies using PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge. Inclusion criteria comprised original studies written in English or German, assessment of diagnosis of dementia, measurement of LOS, and comparison of people with and without dementia. Results Fifty-two of 60 studies reported a longer hospitalization time for PWD compared to PwoD. The extent of the difference in LOS varied between and within countries as well as by type of primary morbidity (eg, injuries, cardiovascular diseases). The range of the LOS difference for studies without restriction to a primary morbidity was -2 to +22 days after matching or adjustment for a variable number and selection of potentially relevant covariates. For studies with injuries/fractures/medical procedures and infectious/vascular disease as the primary morbidity, the range was -2.9 to +12.4 and -11.2 to +21.8 days, respectively. Conclusions The majority of studies reported a longer hospitalization of PWD compared to PwoD. Length of hospital stay seems to be influenced by a variety of medical, social, organizational factors, including reasons for hospital admission, whose role should be explored in detail in further research.},

  abstract = {Prediction models in health care use predictors to estimate for an individual the probability that a condition or disease is already present (diagnostic model) or will occur in the future (prognostic model). Publications on prediction models have become more common in recent years, and competing prediction models frequently exist for the same outcome or target population. Health care providers, guideline developers, and policymakers are often unsure which model to use or recommend, and in which persons or settings. Hence, systematic reviews of these studies are increasingly demanded, required, and performed. A key part of a systematic review of prediction models is examination of risk of bias and applicability to the intended population and setting. To help reviewers with this process, the authors developed PROBAST (Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool) for studies developing, validating, or updating (for example, extending) prediction models, both diagnostic and prognostic. PROBAST was developed through a consensus process involving a group of experts in the field. It includes 20 signaling questions across 4 domains (participants, predictors, outcome, and analysis). This explanation and elaboration document describes the rationale for including each domain and signaling question and guides researchers, reviewers, readers, and guideline developers in how to use them to assess risk of bias and applicability concerns. All concepts are illustrated with published examples across different topics. The latest version of the PROBAST checklist, accompanying documents, and filled-in examples can be downloaded from www.probast.org.},

This paper explores when it is sensible to perform such elicitation and how that can best be done. A number of key issues are discussed, including topics on which there are, and are not, experts who have knowledge that provides a basis for making informed predictive judgments; the inadequacy of only using qualitative uncertainty language; the role of cognitive heuristics and of overconfidence; the choice of experts; the development, refinement, and iterative testing of elicitation protocols that are designed to help experts to consider systematically all relevant knowledge when they make their judgments; the treatment of uncertainty about model functional form; diversity of expert opinion; and when it does or does not make sense to combine judgments from different experts. Although it may be tempting to view expert elicitation as a low-cost, low-effort alternative to conducting serious research and analysis, it is neither. Rather, expert elicitation should build on and use the best available research and analysis and be undertaken only when, given those, the state of knowledge will remain insufficient to support timely informed assessment and decision making.},

Design Systematic review of published IPD meta-analyses, supplemented by a reflection of the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's 20 years' experience of requesting IPD. Data sources Medline, CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, and PsycINFO. Eligibility criteria for study selection IPD meta-analyses of studies of all designs and all clinical areas published in English. Results 760 IPD meta-analyses which identified studies by systematic methods that had been published between 1987 and 2015 were included. Only 188 (25\%) of these IPD meta-analyses retrieved 100\% of the eligible IPD for analysis, with 324 (43\%) of these IPD meta-analyses retrieving 80\% or more of relevant IPD. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that IPD retrieval rates have improved over time. IPD meta-analyses that included only randomised trials, had an authorship policy, included fewer eligible participants, and were conducted outside of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were associated with a high or complete IPD retrieval rate. There was no association between the source of funding of the IPD meta-analyses and IPD retrieval rate. The IPD retrieval rate of the Cochrane Epilepsy Group has declined from 83\% (up to 2005) to 65\% (between 2012 and 2015) and the reported reasons for lack of data availability have changed in recent years. Conclusions IPD meta-analyses are considered to be the ``gold standard'' for the synthesis of data from clinical research studies; however, only 25\% of published IPD meta-analyses have had access to all IPD.},

  abstract = {One in 4 Americans {$>$}40 years of age takes a statin to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and other complications of atherosclerotic disease. The most effective statins produce a mean reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 55\% to 60\% at the maximum dosage, and 6 of the 7 marketed statins are available in generic form, which makes them affordable for most patients. Primarily using data from randomized controlled trials, supplemented with observational data where necessary, this scientific statement provides a comprehensive review of statin safety and tolerability. The review covers the general patient population, as well as demographic subgroups, including the elderly, children, pregnant women, East Asians, and patients with specific conditions such as chronic disease of the kidney and liver, human immunodeficiency viral infection, and organ transplants. The risk of statin-induced serious muscle injury, including rhabdomyolysis, is {$<$}0.1\%, and the risk of serious hepatotoxicity is {$\approx$}0.001\%. The risk of statin-induced newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus is {$\approx$}0.2\% per year of treatment, depending on the underlying risk of diabetes mellitus in the population studied. In patients with cerebrovascular disease, statins possibly increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke; however, they clearly produce a greater reduction in the risk of atherothrombotic stroke and thus total stroke, as well as other cardiovascular events. There is no convincing evidence for a causal relationship between statins and cancer, cataracts, cognitive dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, erectile dysfunction, or tendonitis. In US clinical practices, roughly 10\% of patients stop taking a statin because of subjective complaints, most commonly muscle symptoms without raised creatine kinase. In contrast, in randomized clinical trials, the difference in the incidence of muscle symptoms without significantly raised creatine kinase in statin-treated compared with placebo-treated participants is {$<$}1\%, and it is even smaller (0.1\%) for patients who discontinued treatment because of such muscle symptoms. This suggests that muscle symptoms are usually not caused by pharmacological effects of the statin. Restarting statin therapy in these patients can be challenging, but it is important, especially in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events, for whom prevention of these events is a priority. Overall, in patients for whom statin treatment is recommended by current guidelines, the benefits greatly outweigh the risks.},

Studies on preprints within bioRxiv have been largely focused on article metadata and how often these preprints are downloaded, cited, published, and discussed online. A missing element that has yet to be examined is the language contained within the bioRxiv preprint repository. We sought to compare and contrast linguistic features within bioRxiv preprints to published biomedical text as a whole as this is an excellent opportunity to examine how peer review changes these documents. The most prevalent features that changed appear to be associated with typesetting and mentions of supplementary sections or additional files. In addition to text comparison, we created document embeddings derived from a preprint-trained word2vec model. We found that these embeddings are able to parse out different scientific approaches and concepts, link unannotated preprint-peer reviewed article pairs, and identify journals that publish linguistically similar papers to a given preprint. We also used these embeddings to examine factors associated with the time elapsed between the posting of a first preprint and the appearance of a peer reviewed publication. We found that preprints with more versions posted and more textual changes took longer to publish. Lastly, we constructed a web application (https://greenelab.github.io/preprint-similarity-search/) that allows users to identify which journals and articles that are most linguistically similar to a bioRxiv or medRxiv preprint as well as observe where the preprint would be positioned within a published article landscape.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Triangulation is a method used to increase the credibility and validity of research findings.1 Credibility refers to trustworthiness and how believable a study is; validity is concerned with the extent to which a study accurately reflects or evaluates the concept or ideas being investigated.2 Triangulation, by combining theories, methods or observers in a research study, can help ensure that fundamental biases arising from the use of a single method or a single observer are overcome. Triangulation is also an effort to help explore and explain complex human behaviour using a variety of methods to offer a more balanced explanation to readers.2 It is a procedure that enables validation of data and can be used in both quantitative and qualitative studies. Triangulation can enrich research as it offers a variety of datasets to explain differing aspects of a phenomenon of interest. It also helps refute where one dataset invalidates a supposition generated by another. It can assist the confirming of a hypothesis where one set of findings confirms another set. Finally, triangulation can help explain the results of a study.3 Central to triangulation is the notion that methods leading to the same results give more confidence in the research findings.4  Four types of triangulation are proposed by Denzin (p.301):5 (1)~data triangulation, which~includes matters \ldots},

With no vaccine currently available, using behavioural measures to reduce the spread of the virus within the population is an important tool in mitigating the effects of this pandemic. As such, social distancing measures are being implemented globally and have proven an effective tool in slowing the large-scale spread of the virus.                                         Aim:               This scoping review will focus on answering key questions about the state of the evidence on the behavioural determinants of adherence to social distancing measures in research on COVID-19.~                                         Methods:               A scoping review will be conducted in accordance with guidelines for best practice. Literature searches will be conducted using online databases and grey literature sources. Databases will include Medline, Web of Science, Embase and PsycInfo, alongside relevant pre-print servers. Grey literature will be searched on Google Scholar. Screening, data extraction and quality appraisal will be conducted by members of the research team, with any discrepancies resolved by consensus discussion. Quality appraisal will be conducted using the Cochrane's ROBINS-I tool, the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist where appropriate. Results will be analysed by mapping findings onto the Theoretical Domains Framework and visualising characteristics of the included studies using EviAtlas.

Previous research found that reluctance to share data was related to a higher prevalence of statistical errors, often in the direction of statistical significance (Wicherts, Bakker, \&amp; Molenaar, 2011). We therefore hypothesized that journal policies about data sharing and data sharing itself would reduce these inconsistencies. In Study 1, we compared the prevalence of reporting inconsistencies in two similar journals on decision making with different data sharing policies. In Study 2, we compared reporting inconsistencies in psychology articles published in PLOS journals (with a data sharing policy) and Frontiers in Psychology (without a stipulated data sharing policy). In Study 3, we looked at papers published in the journal Psychological Science to check whether papers with or without an Open Practice Badge differed in the prevalence of reporting errors. Overall, we found no relationship between data sharing and reporting inconsistencies. We did find that journal policies on data sharing are extremely effective in promoting data sharing. We argue that open data is essential in improving the quality of psychological science, and we discuss ways to detect and reduce reporting inconsistencies in the literature.},

However, the causality of these associations is unclear. We sought to assess the causal nature of these associations using Mendelian randomization (MR). Methods and Findings We used SNPs associated with each risk factor as instrumental variables in MR analyses. We considered type 2 diabetes (T2D, NSNPs = 49), fasting glucose (NSNPs = 36), insulin resistance (NSNPs = 10), body mass index (BMI, NSNPs = 32), total cholesterol (NSNPs = 73), HDL-cholesterol (NSNPs = 71), LDL-cholesterol (NSNPs = 57), triglycerides (NSNPs = 39), systolic blood pressure (SBP, NSNPs = 24), smoking initiation (NSNPs = 1), smoking quantity (NSNPs = 3), university completion (NSNPs = 2), and years of education (NSNPs = 1). We calculated MR estimates of associations between each exposure and AD risk using an inverse-variance weighted approach, with summary statistics of SNP\textendash AD associations from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project, comprising a total of 17,008 individuals with AD and 37,154 cognitively normal elderly controls. We found that genetically predicted higher SBP was associated with lower AD risk (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation [15.4 mm Hg] of SBP [95\% CI]: 0.75 [0.62\textendash 0.91]; p = 3.4 \texttimes{} 10-3). Genetically predicted higher SBP was also associated with a higher probability of taking antihypertensive medication (p = 6.7 \texttimes{} 10-8). Genetically predicted smoking quantity was associated with lower AD risk (OR per ten cigarettes per day [95\% CI]: 0.67 [0.51\textendash 0.89]; p = 6.5 \texttimes{} 10-3), although we were unable to stratify by smoking history; genetically predicted smoking initiation was not associated with AD risk (OR = 0.70 [0.37, 1.33]; p = 0.28). We saw no evidence of causal associations between glycemic traits, T2D, BMI, or educational attainment and risk of AD (all p {$>$} 0.1). Potential limitations of this study include the small proportion of intermediate trait variance explained by genetic variants and other implicit limitations of MR analyses. Conclusions Inherited lifetime exposure to higher SBP is associated with lower AD risk. These findings suggest that higher blood pressure\textemdash or some environmental exposure associated with higher blood pressure, such as use of antihypertensive medications\textemdash may reduce AD risk.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Synthesis of multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a systematic review can summarize the effects of individual outcomes and provide numerical answers about the effectiveness of interventions. Filtering of searches is time consuming, and no single method fulfills the principal requirements of speed with accuracy. Automation of systematic reviews is driven by a necessity to expedite the availability of current best evidence for policy and clinical decision-making. We developed Rayyan ( http://rayyan.qcri.org ), a free web and mobile app, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability. For the beta testing phase, we used two published Cochrane reviews in which included studies had been selected manually. Their searches, with 1030 records and 273 records, were uploaded to Rayyan. Different features of Rayyan were tested using these two reviews. We also conducted a survey of Rayyan's users and collected feedback through a built-in feature. RESULTS: Pilot testing of Rayyan focused on usability, accuracy against manual methods, and the added value of the prediction feature. The "taster" review (273 records) allowed a quick overview of Rayyan for early comments on usability. The second review (1030 records) required several iterations to identify the previously identified 11 trials. The "suggestions" and "hints," based on the "prediction model," appeared as testing progressed beyond five included studies. Post rollout user experiences and a reflexive response by the developers enabled real-time modifications and improvements. The survey respondents reported 40\% average time savings when using Rayyan compared to others tools, with 34\% of the respondents reporting more than 50\% time savings. In addition, around 75\% of the respondents mentioned that screening and labeling studies as well as collaborating on reviews to be the two most important features of Rayyan. As of November 2016, Rayyan users exceed 2000 from over 60 countries conducting hundreds of reviews totaling more than 1.6M citations. Feedback from users, obtained mostly through the app web site and a recent survey, has highlighted the ease in exploration of searches, the time saved, and simplicity in sharing and comparing include-exclude decisions. The strongest features of the app, identified and reported in user feedback, were its ability to help in screening and collaboration as well as the time savings it affords to users. CONCLUSIONS: Rayyan is responsive and intuitive in use with significant potential to lighten the load of reviewers.},

  abstract = {Systematic reviews aid the analysis and dissemination of evidence, using rigorous and transparent methods to generate empirically attained answers to focused research questions. Identifying all evidence relevant to the research questions is an essential component, and challenge, of systematic reviews. Grey literature, or evidence not published in commercial publications, can make important contributions to a systematic review. Grey literature can include academic papers, including theses and dissertations, research and committee reports, government reports, conference papers, and ongoing research, among others. It may provide data not found within commercially published literature, providing an important forum for disseminating studies with null or negative results that might not otherwise be disseminated. Grey literature may thusly reduce publication bias, increase reviews' comprehensiveness and timeliness and foster a balanced picture of available evidence. Grey literature's diverse formats and audiences can present a significant challenge in a systematic search for evidence. However, the benefits of including grey literature may far outweigh the cost in time and resource needed to search for it, and it is important for it to be included in a systematic review or review of evidence. A carefully thought out grey literature search strategy may be an invaluable component of a systematic review. This narrative review provides guidance about the benefits of including grey literature in a systematic review, and sources for searching through grey literature. An illustrative example of a search for evidence within grey literature sources is presented to highlight the potential contributions of such a search to a systematic review. Benefits and challenges of grey literature search methods are discussed, and recommendations made.},

  abstract = {Objective To synthesise evidence on the average bias and heterogeneity associated with reported methodological features of randomized trials. Design Systematic review of meta-epidemiological studies. Methods We retrieved eligible studies included in a recent AHRQ-EPC review on this topic (latest search September 2012), and searched Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid EMBASE for studies indexed from Jan 2012-May 2015. Data were extracted by one author and verified by another. We combined estimates of average bias (e.g. ratio of odds ratios (ROR) or difference in standardised mean differences (dSMD)) in meta-analyses using the random-effects model. Analyses were stratified by type of outcome (``mortality'' versus ``other objective'' versus ``subjective''). Direction of effect was standardised so that ROR {$<$} 1 and dSMD {$<$} 0 denotes a larger intervention effect estimate in trials with an inadequate or unclear (versus adequate) characteristic. Results We included 24 studies. The available evidence suggests that intervention effect estimates may be exaggerated in trials with inadequate/unclear (versus adequate) sequence generation (ROR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.86 to 0.99; 7 studies) and allocation concealment (ROR 0.90, 95\% CI 0.84 to 0.97; 7 studies). For these characteristics, the average bias appeared to be larger in trials of subjective outcomes compared with other objective outcomes. Also, intervention effects for subjective outcomes appear to be exaggerated in trials with lack of/unclear blinding of participants (versus blinding) (dSMD -0.37, 95\% CI -0.77 to 0.04; 2 studies), lack of/unclear blinding of outcome assessors (ROR 0.64, 95\% CI 0.43 to 0.96; 1 study) and lack of/unclear double blinding (ROR 0.77, 95\% CI 0.61 to 0.93; 1 study). The influence of other characteristics (e.g. unblinded trial personnel, attrition) is unclear. Conclusions Certain characteristics of randomized trials may exaggerate intervention effect estimates. The average bias appears to be greatest in trials of subjective outcomes. More research on several characteristics, particularly attrition and selective reporting, is needed.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence of cholinesterase inhibitor (ChI) treatment in subjects with dementia in European countries. METHODS: We studied the prevalence of treatment in subjects with dementia among European countries in 2004 (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom) by using estimates of prevalence of dementia and of ChI treatments according to sales and reimbursement data. RESULTS: In 2004, estimated prevalence of ChI use among subjects with dementia ranged from 3.0\% in the Netherlands to 20.3\% in France. It was 17.5\% in Spain, 6.7\% in the UK and 5.9\% in Italy. Donepezil was used by more than 60\% of patients using a single ChI and represented almost 50\% of reimbursements for patients that had used at least two different ChIs during the year. Galantamine and rivastigmine were respectively used by 22 and 18\% of subjects using a single drug and 27 and 23\% of reimbursements for patients that had used at least two different ChIs. Nevertheless, different patterns of use were found for individual countries. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of treatment by ChIs among subjects with dementia remains weak and varies greatly across Europe. Differences in reimbursement rates and health policies could partly explain these variations, as ChIs could have failed to convince health authorities because the outcomes considered for trials are not used by clinicians in their everyday practice. If donepezil was highly predominant across countries, variations in rivastigmine and galantamine importance could reflect local market specificities.},

The aim of this study is to provide an overview and guidance on some of the available methodologies used to address problems related to time-varying exposure and confounding in pharmacoepidemiology and other observational studies. The methods are explored from a conceptual rather than an analytical perspective. Methods: The methods described in this study have been identified exploring the literature concerning to the time-varying exposure concept and basing the search on four fundamental pharmacoepidemiological problems, construction of treatment episodes, time-varying confounders, cumulative exposure and latency, and treatment switching. Results: A correct treatment episodes construction is fundamental to avoid bias in treatment effect estimates. Several methods exist to address time-varying covariates, but the complexity of the most advanced approaches\textemdash eg, marginal structural models or structural nested failure time models\textemdash and the lack of user-friendly statistical packages have prevented broader adoption of these methods. Consequently, simpler methods are most commonly used, including, for example, methods without any adjustment strategy and models with time-varying covariates. The magnitude of exposure needs to be considered and properly modelled. Conclusions: Further research on the application and implementation of the most complex methods is needed. Because different methods can lead to substantial differences in the treatment effect estimates, the application of several methods and comparison of the results is recommended. Treatment episodes estimation and exposure quantification are key parts in the estimation of treatment effects or associations of interest.},

  abstract = {Objective To systematically review the literature relating to the impact of multiple co-occurring modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia. Design A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature relating to the impact of co-occurring key risk factors for incident cognitive decline and dementia. All abstracts and full text were screened independently by two reviewers and each article assessed for bias using a standard checklist. A fixed effects meta-analysis was undertaken. Data sources Databases Medline, Embase and PsycINFO were searched from 1999 to 2017. Eligibility criteria For inclusion articles were required to report longitudinal data from participants free of cognitive decline at baseline, with formal assessment of cognitive function or dementia during follow-up, and an aim to examine the impact of additive or clustered comorbid risk factor burden in with two or more core modifiable risk factors. Results Seventy-nine full-text articles were examined. Twenty-two articles (18 studies) were included reporting data on {$>$}40 000 participants. Included studies consistently reported an increased risk associated with greater numbers of intraindividual risk factors or unhealthy behaviours and the opposite for healthy or protective behaviours. A meta-analysis of studies with dementia outcomes resulted in a pooled relative risk for dementia of 1.20 (95\% CI 1.04 to 1.39) for one risk factor, 1.65 (95\% CI 1.40 to 1.94) for two and 2.21 (95\% CI 1.78 to 2.73) for three or more, relative to no risk factors. Limitations include dependence on published results and variations in study outcome, cognitive assessment, length of follow-up and definition of risk factor exposure. Conclusions The strength of the reported associations, the consistency across studies and the suggestion of a dose response supports a need to keep modifiable risk factor exposure to a minimum and to avoid exposure to additional modifiable risks. Further research is needed to establish whether particular combinations of risk factors confer greater risk than others. PROSPERO registration number 42016052914.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subjects with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have a memory impairment beyond that expected for age and education yet are not demented. These subjects are becoming the focus of many prediction studies and early intervention trials. OBJECTIVE: To characterize clinically subjects with MCI cross-sectionally and longitudinally. DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal inception cohort. SETTING: General community clinic. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 76 consecutively evaluated subjects with MCI were compared with 234 healthy control subjects and 106 patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD), all from a community setting as part of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Center/Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry, Rochester, Minn. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 3 groups of individuals were compared on demographic factors and measures of cognitive function including the Mini-Mental State Examination, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, Dementia Rating Scale, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, and Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Clinical classifications of dementia and AD were determined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria, respectively. RESULTS: The primary distinction between control subjects and subjects with MCI was in the area of memory, while other cognitive functions were comparable. However, when the subjects with MCI were compared with the patients with very mild AD, memory performance was similar, but patients with AD were more impaired in other cognitive domains as well. Longitudinal performance demonstrated that the subjects with MCI declined at a rate greater than that of the controls but less rapidly than the patients with mild AD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who meet the criteria for MCI can be differentiated from healthy control subjects and those with very mild AD. They appear to constitute a clinical entity that can be characterized for treatment interventions.},

However, the exact values of such statistics are commonly hidden in figures.                                               Extracting descriptive statistics from figures can be a slow process that is not easily reproducible. Additionally, current software lacks an ability to incorporate important meta-data (e.g., sample sizes, treatment / variable names) about experiments and is not integrated with other software to streamline analysis pipelines.                                                                  Here we present the R package                   metaDigitise                   which extracts descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations and correlations from four plot types: 1) mean/error plots (e.g. bar graphs with standard errors), 2) box plots, 3) scatter plots and 4) histograms.                   metaDigitise                   is user-friendly and easy to learn as it interactively guides the user through the data extraction process. Notably, it enables large-scale extraction by automatically loading image files, letting the user stop processing, edit and add to the resulting data-frame at any point.                                                                Digitised data can be easily re-plotted and checked, facilitating reproducible data extraction from plots with little inter-observer bias. We hope that by making the process of figure extraction more flexible and easy to conduct it will improve the transparency and quality of meta-analyses in the future.},

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of relevant observational studies to quantify the magnitude of the association between statin therapy and the risk of dementia. \textbf{\emph{Methods:}} We systematically searched for relevant studies published from January 2000 to March 2018 using EMBASE, Google, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Two authors performed study selection, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment. We then extracted data from the selected studies and performed meta-analysis of observational studies using a random-effects model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also conducted. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} A total of 30 observational studies, including 9,162,509 participants (84,101 dementia patients), met the eligibility criteria. Patients with statin had a lower all-caused dementia risk than those without statin (risk ratio [RR] 0.83, 95\% CI 0.79\textendash 0.87, \emph{I}\textsuperscript{2} = 57.73\%). The overall pooled reduction of Alzheimer disease in patients with statin use was RR 0.69 (95\% CI 0.60\textendash 0.80, \emph{p} \&\#x3c; 0.0001), and the overall pooled RR of statin use and vascular dementia risk was RR 0.93 (95\% CI 0.74\textendash 1.16, \emph{p} = 0.54). \textbf{\emph{Conclusion:}} This study suggests that the use of statin is significantly associated with a decreased risk of dementia. Future studies measuring such outcomes would provide useful information to patients, clinicians, and policymakers.

  abstract = {Firm conclusions about whether mid-life or long-term statin use has an impact on cognitive decline and dementia remain elusive. Here, our objective was to systematically review, synthesize and critique the epidemiological literature that examines the relationship between statin use and cognition, so as to assess the current state of knowledge, identify gaps in our understanding, and make recommendations for future research. We summarize the findings of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies, grouped according to study design. We discuss the methods for each, and consider likely sources of bias, such as reverse causation and confounding. Although observational studies that considered statin use at or near the time of dementia diagnosis suggest a protective effect of statins, these findings could be attributable to reverse causation. RCTs and well-conducted observational studies of baseline statin use and subsequent cognition over several years of follow-up do not support a causal preventative effect of late-life statin use on cognitive decline or dementia. Given that much of the human research on statins and cognition in the future will be observational, careful study design and analysis will be essential.},

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between plasma lipid levels and the risk of AD and VaD and the impact of drugs to lower lipid levels on this relationship. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional and prospective community-based cohort studies. PARTICIPANTS: Random sample of 4316 Medicare recipients, 65 years and older, residing in northern Manhattan, NY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vascular dementia and AD according to standard criteria. RESULTS: Elevated levels of non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and decreased levels of HDL-C were weak risk factors for VaD in either cross-sectional or prospective analyses. Higher levels of total cholesterol were associated with a decreased risk of incident AD after adjustment for demographics, apolipoprotein E genotype, and cardiovascular risk factors. Treatment with drugs to lower lipid levels did not change the disease risk of either disorder. CONCLUSIONS: We found a weak relation between non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels and the risk of VaD. Lipid levels and the use of agents to lower them do not seem to be associated with the risk of AD.},

Methods for adjustment of within-trial biases in meta-analysis include the use of empirical evidence from an external collection of meta-analyses, and the use of expert opinion informed by the assessment of detailed trial information. Our aim is to present methods to combine these two approaches to gain the advantages of both. We make use of the risk of bias information that is routinely available in Cochrane reviews, by obtaining empirical distributions for the bias associated with particular bias profiles (combinations of risk of bias judgements). We propose three methods: a formal combination of empirical evidence and opinion in a Bayesian analysis; asking experts to give an opinion on bias informed by both summary trial information and a bias distribution from the empirical evidence, either numerically or by selecting areas of the empirical distribution. The methods are demonstrated through application to two example binary outcome meta-analyses. Bias distributions based on opinion informed by trial information alone were most dispersed on average, and those based on opinions obtained by selecting areas of the empirical distribution were narrowest. Although the three methods for combining empirical evidence with opinion vary in ease and speed of implementation, they yielded similar results in the two examples.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) is an ongoing multi-centre prospective cohort study designed to investigate the relationship between nutrition and cancer, with the potential for studying other diseases as well. The study currently includes 519 978 participants (366 521 women and 153 457 men, mostly aged 35\textendash 70 years) in 23 centres located in 10 European countries, to be followed for cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality for several decades. At enrolment, which took place between 1992 and 2000 at each of the different centres, information was collected through a non-dietary questionnaire on lifestyle variables and through a dietary questionnaire addressing usual diet. Anthropometric measurements were performed and blood samples taken, from which plasma, serum, red cells and buffy coat fractions were separated and aliquoted for long-term storage, mostly in liquid nitrogen. To calibrate dietary measurements, a standardised, computer-assisted 24-hour dietary recall was implemented at each centre on stratified random samples of the participants, for a total of 36 900 subjects. EPIC represents the largest single resource available today world-wide for prospective investigations on the aetiology of cancers (and other diseases) that can integrate questionnaire data on lifestyle and diet, biomarkers of diet and of endogenous metabolism (e.g. hormones and growth factors) and genetic polymorphisms. First results of case\textendash control studies nested within the cohort are expected early in 2003. The present paper provides a description of the EPIC study, with the aim of simplifying reference to it in future papers reporting substantive or methodological studies carried out in the EPIC cohort.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Meta-analysis of individual patient data (IPD) is the "gold-standard" for synthesizing evidence across several studies. Some studies, however, may only provide aggregate data (AD). In this situation researchers might need to combine IPD with AD to utilize all the evidence available. Here, we review applied IPD meta-analysis articles to assess if and how AD is combined with IPD in practice. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A systematic review of articles identified from bibliographic databases and searches. RESULTS: We identified 33 applied IPD articles that combined IPD and AD and 166 that did not. For each article, we recorded the proportion of total studies providing IPD, and found that articles combining IPD and AD had, on average, IPD available in only 64\% of studies (compared to 90\% in articles not combining IPD and AD). Two different methods were used to combine IPD and AD, the two-stage method and analysis of partially reconstructed IPD, but a review of methodological articles identified two further methods, multilevel modeling and Bayesian hierarchical related regression. We summarize each method to aid practitioners. CONCLUSION: Combining IPD and AD is a relevant issue for evidence synthesis, and the further development and validation of suitable meta-analysis methods is needed.},

  abstract = {Precision medicine research often searches for treatment-covariate interactions, which refers to when a treatment effect (eg, measured as a mean difference, odds ratio, hazard ratio) changes across values of a participant-level covariate (eg, age, gender, biomarker). Single trials do not usually have sufficient power to detect genuine treatment-covariate interactions, which motivate the sharing of individual participant data (IPD) from multiple trials for meta-analysis. Here, we provide statistical recommendations for conducting and planning an IPD meta-analysis of randomized trials to examine treatment-covariate interactions. For conduct, two-stage and one-stage statistical models are described, and we recommend: (i) interactions should be estimated directly, and not by calculating differences in meta-analysis results for subgroups; (ii) interaction estimates should be based solely on within-study information; (iii) continuous covariates and outcomes should be analyzed on their continuous scale; (iv) nonlinear relationships should be examined for continuous covariates, using a multivariate meta-analysis of the trend (eg, using restricted cubic spline functions); and (v) translation of interactions into clinical practice is nontrivial, requiring individualized treatment effect prediction. For planning, we describe first why the decision to initiate an IPD meta-analysis project should not be based on between-study heterogeneity in the overall treatment effect; and second, how to calculate the power of a potential IPD meta-analysis project in advance of IPD collection, conditional on characteristics (eg, number of participants, standard deviation of covariates) of the trials (potentially) promising their IPD. Real IPD meta-analysis projects are used for illustration throughout.},

We offer critical review of contemporary dementia research and discuss potential reasons why progress in the field has not been as rapid as in other disciplines. We adopt a broad approach in keeping with the broad nature of the topic. We cover the difficulties inherent in studying dementia from 'bench' to 'bedside' to 'population'. We make particular reference to issues of operationalisation of the dementia syndrome and our evolving understanding of dementia as a research 'outcome'. We discuss contemporary 'hot topics' in dementia research methodology focussing on dementia models, pre-dementia states and biomarkers. Recognising the importance of prospective epidemiological cohorts and large-scale clinical trials we pay particular attention to these approaches and the challenges of generating results that have 'real world' external validity. Based on our thoughts we end with suggestions for future dementia research. Our review is designed to be critical but not unnecessarily negative. There is reason for cautious optimism in dementia research. The recent G8 summit on dementia and subsequent establishment of the World Dementia Council are examples of initiatives that reflect societal and political will to increase research efforts in dementia.},

In addition, the use of a data-derived `optimal' cutpoint leads to serious bias. We illustrate the impact of dichotomization of continuous predictor variables using as a detailed case study a randomized trial in primary biliary cirrhosis.

  abstract = {Objective Improving dementia care is a policy priority nationally and internationally; there is a `diagnosis gap' with less than half of the cases of dementia ever diagnosed. The English Health Department's Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) encourages primary care recognition and recording of dementia. The codes for dementia are complex with the possibility of underidentification through miscoding. We developed guidance on coding of dementia; we report the impact of applying this to `clean up' dementia coding and records at a practice level. Design The guidance had five elements: (1) identify Read Codes for dementia; (2) access QOF dementia register; (3) generate lists of patients who may have dementia; (4) compare search with QOF data and (5) review cases. In each practice, one general practitioner conducted the exercise. The number of dementia QOF registers before and after the exercise was recorded with the hours taken to complete the exercise. Setting London primary care. Participants 23 (85\%) of 27 practices participated, covering 79 312 (19 562 over 65 s) participants. Outcomes The number on dementia QOF registers; time taken. Results The number of people with dementia on QOF registers increased from 1007 to 1139 ({$\chi$}2=8.17, p=0.004), raising identification rates by 8.8\%. It took 4.7 h per practice, on an average. Conclusions These data demonstrate the potential of a simple primary care coding exercise, requiring no specific training, to increase the dementia identification rate. An improvement of 8.8\% between 2011 and 2012 is equivalent to that of the fourth most improved primary care trust in the UK. In absolute terms, if this effects were mirrored across the UK primary care, the number of cases with dementia identified would rise by over 70 000 from 364 329 to 434 488 raising the recognition rate from 46\% to 54.8\%. Implementing this exercise appears to be a simple and effective way to improve recognition rates in primary care.},

Evidence suggests that cholesterol is associated with AD and represents promising targets for intervention. However, the causality of these associations is unclear. Therefore, we sought to conduct a meta-meta-analysis to determine the effect of cholesterol on the development AD. Then, we assessed the effect of serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG), on AD risk. Methods: A systematic search of meta-analyses was conducted. Scopus, Web of Science, Science direct, PubMed and Google academic system databases were reviewed. Results: We found 100 primary studies and five meta-analyses to analyze the relationships between cholesterol and AD. The total effect of cholesterol on risk of AD was significant and heterogeneous. Subgroup analysis shows that LDL-C levels influence the development of AD. However, non-significant effects of HDL-C, TC and TG levels on AD were found. Conclusions: These results strengthen the evidence that LDL-C cholesterol levels increase risk for AD. More initiatives to investigate the relationship between cholesterol and AD are needed.},

However, in the literature, the term confounding by indicationis not always used consistently. The authors found three different situations in which the term has been applied or might have been used but was not: confounding by indication as protopathic bias, as confounding by severity, or as a form of selection bias. It might be helpful to limit use of the term confounding by indication to the situation in which the disease that forms the indication acts as a confounder irrespective of its severity and to applly the term confounding by severity if the severity of this disease acts as a confounder. Protopathic bias and selection bias should not be confused with these terms. The used of appropriate terms ultimately will improve communication among researchers and contribute to the clarity of their papers. Am J Epidemiol 1999; 149: 981\textendash 3.},

  abstract = {Introduction: High-quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide the most reliable evidence on the comparative efficacy of new medicines. However, non-randomised studies (NRS) are increasingly recognised as a source of insights into the real-world performance of novel therapeutic products, particularly when traditional RCTs are impractical or lack generalisability. This means there is a growing need for synthesising evidence from RCTs and NRS in healthcare decision making, particularly given recent developments such as innovative study designs, digital technologies and linked databases across countries. Crucially, however, no formal framework exists to guide the integration of these data types. Objectives and Methods: To address this gap, we used a mixed methods approach (review of existing guidance, methodological papers, Delphi survey) to develop guidance for researchers and healthcare decision-makers on when and how to best combine evidence from NRS and RCTs to improve transparency and build confidence in the resulting summary effect estimates. Results: Our framework comprises seven steps on guiding the integration and interpretation of evidence from NRS and RCTs and we offer recommendations on the most appropriate statistical approaches based on three main analytical scenarios in healthcare decision making (specifically, `high-bar evidence' when RCTs are the preferred source of evidence, `medium,' and `low' when NRS is the main source of inference). Conclusion: Our framework augments existing guidance on assessing the quality of NRS and their compatibility with RCTs for evidence synthesis, while also highlighting potential challenges in implementing it.

  abstract = {Flaws in the design of randomized trials may bias intervention effect estimates and increase between-trial heterogeneity. Empirical evidence suggests that these problems are greatest for subjectively assessed outcomes. For the Risk of Bias in Evidence Synthesis (ROBES) Study, we extracted risk-of-bias judgements (for sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, and incomplete data) from a large collection of meta-analyses published in the Cochrane Library (issue 4; April 2011). We categorized outcome measures as mortality, other objective outcome, or subjective outcome, and we estimated associations of bias judgements with intervention effect estimates using Bayesian hierarchical models. Among 2,443 randomized trials in 228 meta-analyses, intervention effect estimates were, on average, exaggerated in trials with high or unclear (versus low) risk-of-bias judgements for sequence generation (ratio of odds ratios (ROR) = 0.91, 95\% credible interval (CrI): 0.86, 0.98), allocation concealment (ROR = 0.92, 95\% CrI: 0.86, 0.98), and blinding (ROR = 0.87, 95\% CrI: 0.80, 0.93). In contrast to previous work, we did not observe consistently different bias for subjective outcomes compared with mortality. However, we found an increase in between-trial heterogeneity associated with lack of blinding in meta-analyses with subjective outcomes. Inconsistency in criteria for risk-of-bias judgements applied by individual reviewers is a likely limitation of routinely collected bias assessments. Inadequate randomization and lack of blinding may lead to exaggeration of intervention effect estimates in randomized trials.},

  abstract = {Statins are the treatment of choice for the management of hypercholesterolaemia because of their proven efficacy and safety profile. They also have an increasing role in managing cardiovascular risk in patients with relatively normal levels of plasma cholesterol. Although all statins share a common mechanism of action, they differ in terms of their chemical structures, pharmacokinetic profiles, and lipid-modifying efficacy. The chemical structures of statins govern their water solubility, which in turn influences their absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin are derived from fungal metabolites and have elimination half-lives of 1-3 h. Atorvastatin, cerivastatin (withdrawn from clinical use in 2001), fluvastatin, pitavastatin and rosuvastatin are fully synthetic compounds, with elimination half-lives ranging from 1 h for fluvastatin to 19 h for rosuvastatin. Atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin and pitavastatin are relatively lipophilic compounds. Lipophilic statins are more susceptible to metabolism by the cytochrome P(450) system, except for pitavastatin, which undergoes limited metabolism via this pathway. Pravastatin and rosuvastatin are relatively hydrophilic and not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P(450) enzymes. All statins are selective for effect in the liver, largely because of efficient first-pass uptake; passive diffusion through hepatocyte cell membranes is primarily responsible for hepatic uptake of lipophilic statins, while hydrophilic agents are taken up by active carrier-mediated processes. Pravastatin and rosuvastatin show greater hepatoselectivity than lipophilic agents, as well as a reduced potential for uptake by peripheral cells. The bioavailability of the statins differs greatly, from 5\% for lovastatin and simvastatin to 60\% or greater for cerivastatin and pitavastatin. Clinical studies have demonstrated rosuvastatin to be the most effective for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, followed by atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin. As a class, statins are generally well tolerated and serious adverse events, including muscle toxicity leading to rhabdomyolysis, are rare. Consideration of the differences between the statins helps to provide a rational basis for their use in clinical practice.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vascular risk factors have been proposed as important targets for the prevention of dementia. As lipid fractions represent easily modifiable targets, we examined the longitudinal relationship of baseline lipid fractions with 13-y incident dementia and its subtypes (Alzheimer disease [AD] and mixed or vascular dementia) in older community-dwelling persons. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Non-institutionalized persons aged 65+ y (n = 9,294) were recruited for the Three-City Study (3C Study), a population-based cohort study from the electoral rolls of the cities of Dijon, Bordeaux, and Montpellier, France, between March 1999 and March 2001. Follow-up examinations were performed every 2 y after the baseline assessment. The final study sample comprised 7,470 participants from the 3C Study (mean age {$\pm$} standard deviation [SD] 73.8 {$\pm$} 5.3 y, 61.0\% women) who were prospectively followed up for up to 13 y. Fasting lipid fractions (triglycerides [TGs], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], total cholesterol [TC]) were studied as continuous variables, and results are reported per SD increase of each lipid fraction. Incident dementia and its subtypes were studied as censored variables using Cox models with age as time scale. Analyses were adjusted for sex, study center, and educational level, as well as vascular risk factors and apolipoprotein E (APOE) {$\epsilon$}4 genotype. We corrected for multiple testing, yielding a significance threshold of 0.0169. p-Values above the significance threshold but less than 0.05 were considered nominally significant. During a mean ({$\pm$} SD) follow-up period of 7.9 {$\pm$} 3.6 y, 779 participants developed incident dementia (n = 532 AD and n = 154 mixed or vascular dementia). Higher LDL-C and TC concentrations at baseline were associated with an increased risk of AD (hazard ratio [HR] per SD increase = 1.13 [95\% CI 1.04-1.22], p = 0.0045, and HR = 1.12 [1.03-1.22], p = 0.0072, respectively). These associations were largely unchanged after adjustment for vascular risk factors and were attenuated after adjustment for APOE{$\epsilon$}4 (HR per SD increase = 1.12 [1.03-1.23], p = 0.0110, and HR = 1.12 [1.02-1.23], p = 0.0171, respectively). Higher TG concentrations at baseline were associated with an increased risk of all dementia (HR per SD increase = 1.11 [1.03-1.19], p = 0.0044) and mixed or vascular dementia (HR = 1.21 [1.04-1.41], p = 0.0163). However, these associations disappeared after adjusting for vascular risk factors (HR = 1.07 [0.98-1.17], p = 0.1374, and HR = 1.17 [0.96-1.42], p = 0.1206, respectively). Main limitations of the study include interval censoring of incident dementia cases, potential selective survival bias, and the fact that variation in lipid concentrations during follow-up could not be accounted for in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In a large population-based sample of older community-dwelling persons with up to 13 y of follow-up, we observed that higher LDL-C and TC concentrations were associated with an increased risk of AD. This result was independent of vascular risk factors and was attenuated after adjustment for APOE{$\epsilon$}4 carrier status. TG and HDL-C concentrations were not associated with risk of incident dementia or its subtypes after accounting for vascular risk factors.},

  abstract = {Nearly 30\% of adults 40~years and older in the United States are on a statin. Their widespread use heightens the importance of careful consideration of their varied effects on the body. Although randomized controlled trials have not confirmed cognitive impairing effects with statins, continuing evidence suggests statins have the ability to cause reversible cognitive impairment in some patients. Paradoxically, statins have also been shown to decrease the risk of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and improve cognitive impairment in some cases. However, randomized controlled trials have similarly failed to find the beneficial effect. Supporting evidence for both claims is compelling whereas known limitations of the clinical trials may explain the lack of findings. This narrative review aims to explain why there is still controversy and how both effects can, and may, be possible. The mechanisms that have been hypothesized for each effect are seemingly independent from one another and may explain the contradicting results. Being mindful of the complex effects of statins, health care providers need to be able to identify patients who are at risk for or already experiencing cognitive impairment from statin use while also identifying those who could potentially decrease their risk of dementia with statins.},

  abstract = {Objective Competing events are often ignored in epidemiological studies. Conventional methods for the analysis of survival data assume independent or noninformative censoring, which is violated when subjects that experience a competing event are censored. Because many survival studies do not apply competing risk analysis, we explain and illustrate in a nonmathematical way how to analyze and interpret survival data in the presence of competing events. Study Design and Setting Using data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, both marginal analyses (Kaplan\textendash Meier method and Cox proportional-hazards regression) and competing risk analyses (cumulative incidence function [CIF], cause-specific and subdistribution hazard regression) were performed. We analyzed the association between sex and depressive symptoms, in which death before the onset of depression was a competing event. Results The Kaplan\textendash Meier method overestimated the cumulative incidence of depressive symptoms. Instead, the CIF should be used. As the subdistribution hazard model has a one-to-one relation with the CIF, it is recommended for prediction research, whereas the cause-specific hazard model is recommended for etiologic research. Conclusion When competing risks are present, the type of research question guides the choice of the analytical model to be used. In any case, results should be presented for all event types.},

Confirmation that presenilin is the catalytic site of {$\gamma$}-secretase has provided a linchpin: all dominant mutations causing early-onset AD occur either in the substrate (amyloid precursor protein, APP) or the protease (presenilin) of the reaction that generates A{$\beta$}. Duplication of the wild-type APP gene in Down's syndrome leads to A{$\beta$} deposits in the teens, followed by microgliosis, astrocytosis, and neurofibrillary tangles typical of AD. Apolipoprotein E4, which predisposes to AD in {$>~$}40\% of cases, has been found to impair A{$\beta$} clearance from the brain. Soluble oligomers of A{$\beta$}42 isolated from AD patients' brains can decrease synapse number, inhibit long-term potentiation, and enhance long-term synaptic depression in rodent hippocampus, and injecting them into healthy rats impairs memory. The human oligomers also induce hyperphosphorylation of tau at AD-relevant epitopes and cause neuritic dystrophy in cultured neurons. Crossing human APP with human tau transgenic mice enhances tau-positive neurotoxicity. In humans, new studies show that low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A{$\beta$}42 and amyloid-PET positivity precede other AD manifestations by many years. Most importantly, recent trials of three different A{$\beta$} antibodies (solanezumab, crenezumab, and aducanumab) have suggested a slowing of cognitive decline in post hoc analyses of mild AD subjects. Although many factors contribute to AD pathogenesis, A{$\beta$} dyshomeostasis has emerged as the most extensively validated and compelling therapeutic target.},

This review focuses on the diagnosis of these conditions and their underlying pathogenesis, in particular immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy. Areas covered Clinical phenotypes including rhabdomyolysis, myalgia and/or mild hyperCKemia, self-limited toxin statin myopathy, and immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy are herein described. Therapeutic recommendations and a diagnostic algorithm in statin-associated myopathy are also proposed. The etiology and pathogenesis of statin-induced myopathy has mainly focused on the anti-HMGCR antibodies and the responsibility of the immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy is discussed. The fact that patients who have not been exposed to statins may develop statin-associated autoimmune myopathy with anti-HMGCR antibodies is also addressed. The literature search strategy included terms identified by searches of PubMed between 1969 and December 2017. The search terms `myositis', `statin-induced autoimmune myopathy', `immunemediate necrotizing myopathy', `statins', `muscular manifestations', and `anti-HMGCR antibodies' were used. Expert commentary Full characterization of the known phenotypes of statin toxicity and the specific role of the anti-HMGCR in those exposed and not exposed (i.e. juvenile forms) to statins and in some types of neoplasms is of paramount relevance.},

Preprint servers decouple dissemination of research papers from their evaluation and certification by journals, allowing researchers to share work immediately, receive feedback from a much larger audience, and provide evidence of productivity long before formal publication. Launched in 2013 as a non-profit community service, the bioRxiv server has brought preprint practice to the life sciences and recently posted its 64,000th manuscript. The server now receives more than four million views per month and hosts papers spanning all areas of biology. Initially dominated by evolutionary biology, genetics/genomics and computational biology, bioRxiv has been increasingly populated by papers in neuroscience, cell and developmental biology, and many other fields. Changes in journal and funder policies that encourage preprint posting have helped drive adoption, as has the development of bioRxiv technologies that allow authors to transfer papers easily between the server and journals. A bioRxiv user survey found that 42\% of authors post their preprints prior to journal submission whereas 37\% post concurrently with journal submission. Authors are motivated by a desire to share work early; they value the feedback they receive, and very rarely experience any negative consequences of preprint posting. Rapid dissemination via bioRxiv is also encouraging new initiatives that experiment with the peer review process and the development of novel approaches to literature filtering and assessment.},

These dependability models depend on precise specifications, but it is often impractical to obtain precise specifications of practical software-intensive systems. Furthermore, the criteria for acceptable behavior vary from time to time and from one user to another. When development methods are based on the classic models that assume precise specifications, the resulting systems are often brittle --- they are vulnerable to unexpected conditions and hard to tune to changing expectations. Practical systems would be better served by development models that recognize the variability and unpredictability of the environment in which the systems are used. Such development methods should pursue not the absolute criterion of correctness, but rather the goal of fitness for the intended task, or sufficient correctness. They should accommodate environmental unpredictability not only by reactive mechanisms, but also by design that produces resilience to environmental change, or homeostasis. In many cases, this resilience may be achievable by relaxing tolerances in the specifications, thereby enlarging the envelope of acceptable operation.},

Our aim was to test the benefits of pravastatin treatment in an elderly cohort of men and women with, or at high risk of developing, cardiovascular disease and stroke. METHODS: We did a randomised controlled trial in which we assigned 5804 men (n=2804) and women (n=3000) aged 70-82 years with a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease to pravastatin (40 mg per day; n=2891) or placebo (n=2913). Baseline cholesterol concentrations ranged from 4.0 mmol/L to 9.0 mmol/L. Follow-up was 3.2 years on average and our primary endpoint was a composite of coronary death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and fatal or non-fatal stroke. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: Pravastatin lowered LDL cholesterol concentrations by 34\% and reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint to 408 events compared with 473 on placebo (hazard ratio 0.85, 95\% CI 0.74-0.97, p=0.014). Coronary heart disease death and non-fatal myocardial infarction risk was also reduced (0.81, 0.69-0.94, p=0.006). Stroke risk was unaffected (1.03, 0.81-1.31, p=0.8), but the hazard ratio for transient ischaemic attack was 0.75 (0.55-1.00, p=0.051). New cancer diagnoses were more frequent on pravastatin than on placebo (1.25, 1.04-1.51, p=0.020). However, incorporation of this finding in a meta-analysis of all pravastatin and all statin trials showed no overall increase in risk. Mortality from coronary disease fell by 24\% (p=0.043) in the pravastatin group. Pravastatin had no significant effect on cognitive function or disability. INTERPRETATION: Pravastatin given for 3 years reduced the risk of coronary disease in elderly individuals. PROSPER therefore extends to elderly individuals the treatment strategy currently used in middle aged people.},

Our results indicate that monacolin J derivatives (natural and semi-synthetic statins) are the best candidates for the prevention of neurodegenerative conditions due to their higher potential BBB penetration capacity, cholesterol lowering effect on neurons with a satisfactory safety profile, and in vitro protection against cell death caused by okadaic acid in culture. Among the nine statins studied, simvastatin presented the best characteristics for preventing neurodegenerative conditions.},

Kappa is defined, in both weighted and unweighted forms, and its use is illustrated with examples from musculoskeletal research. Factors that can influence the magnitude of kappa (prevalence, bias, and nonindependent ratings) are discussed, and ways of evaluating the magnitude of an obtained kappa are considered.

Method A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed comparing survival in patients with resected stage II colorectal cancer and high-risk features having postoperative chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy. Results Of 1031 articles screened, 29 were included, reporting on 183,749 participants. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR]=0.61, P{$<$}0.0001), disease-specific survival (HR=0.73, P=0.05), and disease-free survival (HR=0.59, P{$<$}0.0001) compared to no chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased 5-year overall survival (odds ratio [OR]=0.53, P=0.0008) and 5-year disease-free survival (OR=0.50, P=0.001). Overall survival and disease-free survival remained significantly prolonged during subgroup analysis of studies published from 2015 onwards (HR=0.60, P{$<$}0.0001; HR=0.65, P=0.0001; respectively), in patients with two or more high-risk features (HR=0.59, P=0.0001; HR=0.70, P=0.03; respectively), and in colon cancer (HR=0.61, P{$<$}0.0001; HR=0.51, P=0.0001; respectively). Overall survival, disease-specific survival, and disease-free survival during subgroup analysis of individual high-risk features, were: T4 tumour (HR=0.58, P{$<$}0.0001; HR 0.50, P=0.003; HR 0.75, P=0.05), {$<$}12 lymph nodes harvested (HR=0.67, P=0.0002; HR=0.80, P=0.17; HR=0.72, P=0.02), poor differentiation (HR=0.84, P=0.35; HR=0.85, P=0.23; HR=0.61, P=0.41), lymphovascular or perineural invasion (HR=0.55, P=0.05; HR=0.59, P=0.11; HR=0.76, P=0.05), emergency surgery (HR=0.60, P=0.02; HR=0.68, P=0.19). Conclusion Adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk stage II colorectal cancer results in a modest survival improvement and should be considered on an individual patient basis. Due to potential heterogeneity and selection bias of the included studies, and lack of separate rectal cancer data, further large randomized trials with predefined inclusion criteria and standardized chemotherapy regimens are required.},

Adopting STROBE-MR should help readers, reviewers, and journal editors evaluate the quality of published MR studies. This article explains the 20 items of the STROBE-MR checklist, along with their meaning and rationale, using terms defined in a glossary. Examples of transparent reporting are used for each item to illustrate best practices.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides 200\textendash 499 mg/dL) is relatively common in the United States, whereas more severe triglyceride elevations (very high triglycerides, {$\geq$}500 mg/dL) are far less frequently observed. Both are becoming increasingly prevalent in the United States and elsewhere, likely driven in large part by growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus. In a 2002 American Heart Association scientific statement, the omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were recommended (at a dose of 2\textendash 4 g/d) for reducing triglycerides in patients with elevated triglycerides. Since 2002, prescription agents containing EPA+DHA or EPA alone have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating very high triglycerides; these agents are also widely used for hypertriglyceridemia. The purpose of this advisory is to summarize the lipid and lipoprotein effects resulting from pharmacological doses of n-3 FAs ({$>$}3 g/d total EPA+DHA) on the basis of new scientific data and availability of n-3 FA agents. In treatment of very high triglycerides with 4 g/d, EPA+DHA agents reduce triglycerides by {$\geq$}30\% with concurrent increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas EPA-only did not raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in very high triglycerides. When used to treat hypertriglyceridemia, n-3 FAs with EPA+DHA or with EPA-only appear roughly comparable for triglyceride lowering and do not increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy or in combination with a statin. In the largest trials of 4 g/d prescription n-3 FA, non\textendash high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were modestly decreased, indicating reductions in total atherogenic lipoproteins. The use of n-3 FA (4 g/d) for improving atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in patients with hypertriglyceridemia is supported by a 25\% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With EPA Intervention Trial), a randomized placebo-controlled trial of EPA-only in high-risk patients treated with a statin. The results of a trial of 4 g/d prescription EPA+DHA in hypertriglyceridemia are anticipated in 2020. We conclude that prescription n-3 FAs (EPA+DHA or EPA-only) at a dose of 4 g/d ({$>$}3 g/d total EPA+DHA) are an effective and safe option for reducing triglycerides as monotherapy or as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering agents.},

METHODS We undertook a population-based cohort study to assess the effect of statins on a range of health outcomes using a propensity score-based method to control for differences between people prescribed and not prescribed statins. We validated our design by comparing our results for vascular outcomes with the effects established in large randomized trials. The study was based on the United Kingdom Health Improvement Network database that includes the computerized medical records of over four and a half million patients. RESULTS People who initiated treatment with a statin (n = 129 288) were compared with a matched sample of 600 241 people who did not initiate treatment, with a median follow-up period of 4.4 years. Statin use was not associated with an effect on a wide range of outcomes, including infections, fractures, venous thromboembolism, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, or on specific eye, neurological or autoimmune diseases. A protective effect against dementia was observed (hazard ratio 0.80, 99\% confidence interval 0.68, 0.95). There was no effect on the risk of cancer even after {$\geq$}8 years of follow-up. The effect sizes for statins on vascular end-points and mortality were comparable to those observed in large randomized trials, suggesting bias and confounding had been well controlled for. CONCLUSIONS We found little evidence to support wide-ranging effects of statins on health outcomes beyond their established beneficial effect on vascular disease.},

In addition, genetic instruments have not been proposed before to examine whether liability to T2D might cause greater proportional statin-induced LDL-C lowering. Using summary-level statistics from the Genomic Investigation of Statin Therapy (GIST, nmax\,=\,40,914) and DIAGRAM (nmax\,=\,159,208) consortia, we found a positive genetic correlation between LDL-C statin response and T2D using LD score regression (rgenetic\,=\,0.36, s.e.\,=\,0.13). However, mendelian randomization analyses did not provide support for statin response having a causal effect on T2D risk (OR 1.00 (95\% CI: 0.97, 1.03) per 10\% increase in statin response), nor that liability to T2D has a causal effect on statin-induced LDL-C response (0.20\% increase in response (95\% CI: -0.40, 0.80) per doubling of odds of liability to T2D). Although we found no evidence to suggest that proportional statin response influences T2D risk, a definitive assessment should be made in populations comprised exclusively of statin users, as the presence of nonstatin users in the DIAGRAM dataset may have substantially diluted our effect estimate.},

  abstract = {Statin is one of the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide. Besides reduction of cardiovascular risks, statins have been proposed for the prevention or treatment of other disorders, but results from clinical studies are mixed. There are also controversies concerning the adverse effects caused by statins. In this study we employed a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach across a wide range of complex traits to explore repositioning opportunities and side-effects of statins. MR is analogous to a ``naturalistic'' randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is much less susceptible to confounding and reverse causation as compared to observational studies. We employed two genetic instruments (rs12916 and rs17238484) in the HMGCR gene which have been shown to provide reliable estimates of the risk of statins on type 2 diabetes and weight gain. We observed in the single- and joint-SNP analysis that low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction from HMG-CoA reductase inhibition results in increased depressive symptoms. This finding appeared to be supported by nominally significant results of raised major depression risk in single-SNP MR analysis of rs17238484, and analyses using LDL-C as the exposure. Several other outcomes also reached nominal significance (p {$<$} 0.05) in single- or joint-SNP analyses; for example, we observed causal associations of LDL-C lowering from HMG-CoA reductase inhibition with reduced risks of schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, as well as increased forearm bone mineral density, sleep duration and extreme longevity (highest q-value = 0.289). We also found evidence of casual relationships of LDL-C levels with schizophrenia, anorexia, sleep duration and longevity, following the same association directions as in analyses of HMGCR variants. These findings were at least partially supported by previous clinical studies. We did not observe associations with cognitive test profiles, renal outcomes, autoimmune diseases or cancers. While MR has its limitations and our findings remain to be confirmed in further studies, this work demonstrates the potential of a phenome-wide approach to reveal novel therapeutic indications and unknown drug side-effects.},

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are a common method of synthesizing findings and providing reliable estimates of the effect of a genetic variant on a trait of interest. However, summary estimates are subject to bias due to the varying methodological quality of individual studies. We embarked on an effort to develop and evaluate a tool that assesses the quality of published genetic association studies. Performance characteristics (i.e. validity, reliability, and item discrimination) were evaluated using a sample of thirty studies randomly selected from a previously conducted systematic review. Results The tool demonstrates excellent psychometric properties and generates a quality score for each study with corresponding ratings of `low', `moderate', or `high' quality. We applied our tool to a published systematic review to exclude studies of low quality, and found a decrease in heterogeneity and an increase in precision of summary estimates. Conclusion This tool can be used in systematic reviews to inform the selection of studies for inclusion, to conduct sensitivity analyses, and to perform meta-regressions.

Methods The Kaiser Permanente Northern California Medical Group (healthcare delivery organization) formed the database for this study. The 9,844 participants underwent detailed health evaluations during 1964\textendash 1973 at ages 40\textendash 45 years; they were still members of the health plan in 1994. AD and VaD were ascertained by medical records between 1 January 1994 and 1 June 2007. Cox proportional hazards models \textendash{} adjusted for age, education, race/ethnic group, sex, midlife diabetes, hypertension, BMI and late-life stroke \textendash{} were conducted. Results In total, 469 participants had AD and 127 had VaD. With desirable cholesterol levels ({$<$}200 mg/dl) as a reference, hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% CI for AD were 1.23 (0.97\textendash 1.55) and 1.57 (1.23\textendash 2.01) for borderline (200\textendash 239 mg/dl) and high cholesterol ({$\geq$}240 mg/dl), respectively. HR and 95\% CI for VaD were 1.50 (1.01\textendash 2.23) for borderline and 1.26 (0.82\textendash 1.96) for high cholesterol. Further analyses for AD (cholesterol quartiles, 1st quartile reference) indicated that cholesterol levels {$>$}220 mg/dl were a significant risk factor: HR were 1.31 (1.01\textendash 1.71; 3rd quartile, 221\textendash 248 mg/dl) and 1.58 (1.22\textendash 2.06; 4th quartile, 249\textendash 500 mg/dl). Conclusion Midlife serum total cholesterol was associated with an increased risk of AD and VaD. Even moderately elevated cholesterol increased dementia risk. Dementia risk factors need to be addressed as early as midlife, before underlying disease(s) or symptoms appear.},

We conducted a systematic review of tools designed for risk of bias and/or quality of evidence assessment in (MR) studies, and a review of systematic reviews of MR studies. Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Web of Science, preprints servers and Google Scholar for articles containing tools for assessing, conducting and/or reporting MR studies. We also searched for systematic reviews and protocols of systematic reviews of MR. From eligible articles we collected data on tool characteristics and content, as well as details of narrative description of bias assessment. Results Our searches retrieved 2464 records to screen, from which 14 tools, 35 systematic reviews and 38 protocols were included in our review. Seven tools were designed for assessing risk of bias/quality of evidence in MR studies and evaluation of their content revealed that all seven tools addressed the three core assumptions of instrumental variable analysis, violation of which can potentially introduce bias in MR analysis estimates. Conclusions We present an overview of tools and methods to assess risk of bias/quality of evidence in MR analysis. As none of these methods has been tested and validated for general use, we do not provide recommendations on their use. Our findings should raise awareness about the importance of bias related to MR analysis and provide information that is useful for assessment of MR studies in the context of systematic reviews.},

However the distinction between analyses based on information extracted from the published literature and those based on collecting and reanalysing updated individual patient data is not clear. We have investigated the difference between meta-analysis of the literature (MAL) and meta-analysis of individual patient data (MAP) by comparing the two approaches using randomised trials of cisplatin-based therapy in ovarian cancer. The MAL was based on 788 patients and the MAP on 1329 and estimated median follow-ups were 3{$\cdot$}5 and 6{$\cdot$}5 years, respectively. The MAL gave a result of greater statistical significance (p=0{$\cdot$}027 vs p=0{$\cdot$}30) and an estimate of absolute treatment effect three times as large as the MAP (7{$\cdot$}5\% vs 2{$\cdot$}5\%). Publication bias, patient exclusion, length of follow-up, and method of analysis all contributed to this observed difference. The results of a meta-analysis of the literature alone may be misleading. Whenever possible, a meta-analysis of updated individual patient data should be done because this provides the least biased and most reliable means of addressing questions that have not been satisfactorily resolved by individual clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Purpose Recent observational studies suggest that various drugs are remarkably effective at reducing morbidity and mortality. These cohort studies used a flawed approach to design and data analysis which can lead to immortal time bias. We describe the bias from 20 of these studies and illustrate it by showing that unrelated drugs can be made to appear effective at treating cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods The illustration used a cohort of 3315 patients, with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), identified from the Saskatchewan Health databases, hospitalised for CVD and followed for up to a year. We used the biased approach to assess the effect of two medications, namely gastrointestinal drugs (GID) and inhaled beta-agonists (IBA), both unknown to be effective in CVD, on the risk of all-cause mortality. We also estimated these effects using the proper person-time approach. Results Using the inappropriate approach, the rates ratios of all-cause death were 0.73 (95\%CI: 0.57\textendash 0.93), with IBA and 0.78 (95\%CI: 0.61\textendash 0.99), with GID. These rate ratios became 0.98 (95\%CI: 0.77\textendash 1.25) and 0.94 (95\%CI: 0.73\textendash 1.20), respectively, with the proper person-time analysis. Conclusions Several recent observational studies used a flawed approach to design and data analysis, leading to immortal time bias, which can generate an illusion of treatment effectiveness. Observational studies, with surprising beneficial drug effects should be re-assessed to account for this source of bias. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Immortal time is a span of cohort follow-up during which, because of exposure definition, the outcome under study could not occur. Bias from immortal time was first identified in the 1970s in epidemiology in the context of cohort studies of the survival benefit of heart transplantation. It recently resurfaced in pharmacoepidemiology, with several observational studies reporting that various medications can be extremely effective at reducing morbidity and mortality. These studies, while using different cohort designs, all involved some form of immortal time and the corresponding bias. In this paper, the author describes various cohort study designs leading to this bias, quantifies its magnitude under different survival distributions, and illustrates it by using data from a cohort of lung cancer patients. The author shows that for time-based, event-based, and exposure-based cohort definitions, the bias in the rate ratio resulting from misclassified or excluded immortal time increases proportionately to the duration of immortal time. The bias is more pronounced with a decreasing hazard function for the outcome event, as illustrated with the Weibull distribution compared with a constant hazard from the exponential distribution. In conclusion, observational studies of drug benefit in which computerized databases are used must be designed and analyzed properly to avoid immortal time bias.},

This structured approach serves as a visual aid in the scientific discussion by making underlying relations explicit.

Ultimately, these examples will show that DAGs can be preferable to the traditional methods to identify sources of confounding, especially in complex research questions.},

  abstract = {Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease         , Cardiovascular disease (CVD), which comprises heart attacks (myocardial infarction), angina and strokes, is ranked as the number one cause of mortality and is a major cause of morbidity world wide. High blood cholesterol is linked to CVD events and is an important risk factor. Reducing high blood cholesterol, is thus an important way to reduce the chances of suffering a CVD event. Statins - cholesterol lowering drugs - (e.g. simvastatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin) are the first-choice treatments. Since the early statin randomised controlled trials were reported in the 1990s, several reviews of the effects of statins have been published highlighting their benefits particularly in people with a past history of CVD. Benefits include a reduction in CVD events. Statins have also been shown to reduce the risk of a first event in otherwise healthy individuals at high risk of CVD (primary prevention) but information on possible hazards has not been reported fully. The aim of this updated systematic review is to assess the effects, both in terms of benefits and harms of statins, for the primary prevention of CVD. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE until 2011. We found 18 randomised controlled trials with 19 trial arms (56,934 patients) dating from 1994 to 2008. All were randomised control trials comparing statins with usual care or placebo. The mean age of the participants was 57 years (range 28 - 97 years), 60.3\% were men, and of the eight trials that reported on ethnicity, 85.9 \% were Caucasian. Duration of treatment was a minimum one year and with follow-up of a minimum of six months. All-cause mortality and fatal and non-fatal CVD events were reduced with the use of statins as was the need for revascularisation (the restoration of an adequate blood supply to the heart) by means of surgery (coronary artery bypass graft ) or by angioplasty (PTCA). Of 1000 people treated with a statin for five years, 18 would avoid a major CVD event which compares well with other treatments used for preventing cardiovascular disease. Taking statins did not increase the risk of serious adverse effects such as cancer. Statins are likely to be cost-effective in primary prevention.},

We aimed to estimate the long-term effectiveness of varenicline on smoking cessation, and to determine whether the effectiveness of varenicline differs by socioeconomic status.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We conducted a prospective cohort study of electronic medical records within the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), using three different analytical methods: multivariable logistic regression, propensity score matching, and instrumental variable analyses. Our sample comprised 220 136 patients who were prescribed either NRT (n=149 526) or varenicline (70 610) between Sept 1, 2006, and Sept 30, 2015, who attended 654 general practices in the UK. Primary outcome was smoking cessation at 2 year follow-up. The outcome and covariates were defined with validated code lists and algorithms. Socioeconomic status was defined with the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). We used multiple imputation to impute missing values of body-mass index (13{$\cdot$}6\%) and IMD (0{$\cdot$}1\%).{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Patients prescribed varenicline were more likely than those prescribed NRT to successfully quit smoking after 2 years (odds ratio 1{$\cdot$}26, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}23 to 1{$\cdot$}29; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001); results from the propensity score matching were similar. The association persisted up to 4 years' follow-up. Instrumental variable analysis indicated that, for every 100 patients treated with varenicline rather than NRT, an additional 4{$\cdot$}99 patients (95\% CI 3{$\cdot$}01 to 6{$\cdot$}98, p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001) would be expected to quit up to 2 years after treatment. On average patients had 2{$\cdot$}6 smoking cessation prescriptions in the 2 years after first prescription. We found little evidence that the effectiveness of varenicline differed by socioeconomic status.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Patients prescribed varenicline in primary care were less likely to smoke after 2 years than were those prescribed NRT. This is the largest study to date, to our knowledge, to investigate the effectiveness of varenicline for smoking cessation when used in real-world primary care. Although our results could be subject to residual confounding, they are consistent with results from a network meta-analysis and large randomised controlled trial, and together could be used to update clinical guidelines on the use of varenicline for smoking cessation.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}This research was funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) (MR/N01006X/1) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment (HTA) programme (project number 14/49/94).

  abstract = {Unobserved confounding can seldom be ruled out with certainty in nonexperimental studies. Negative controls are sometimes used in epidemiologic practice to detect the presence of unobserved confounding. An outcome is said to be a valid negative control variable to the extent that it is influenced by unobserved confounders of the exposure effects on the outcome in view, although not directly influenced by the exposure. Thus, a negative control outcome found to be empirically associated with the exposure after adjustment for observed confounders indicates that unobserved confounding may be present. In this paper, we go beyond the use of control outcomes to detect possible unobserved confounding and propose to use control outcomes in a simple but formal counterfactual-based approach to correct causal effect estimates for bias due to unobserved confounding. The proposed control outcome calibration approach is developed in the context of a continuous or binary outcome, and the control outcome and the exposure can be discrete or continuous. A sensitivity analysis technique is also developed, which can be used to assess the degree to which a violation of the main identifying assumption of the control outcome calibration approach might impact inference about the effect of the exposure on the outcome in view.},

In observational data, this approach can produce misleading causal-effect estimates. The present article uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and simple simulations to provide an accessible explanation for why change scores do not estimate causal effects in observational data.Data were simulated to match three general scenarios in which the outcome variable at baseline was a (i) `competing exposure' (i.e. a cause of the outcome that is neither caused by nor causes the exposure), (ii) confounder or (iii) mediator for the total causal effect of the exposure variable at baseline on the outcome variable at follow-up. Regression coefficients were compared between change-score analyses and the appropriate estimator(s) for the total and/or direct causal effect(s).Change-score analyses do not provide meaningful causal-effect estimates unless the baseline outcome variable is a `competing exposure' for the effect of the exposure on the outcome at follow-up. Where the baseline outcome is a confounder or mediator, change-score analyses evaluate obscure estimands, which may diverge substantially in magnitude and direction from the total and direct causal effects.Future observational studies that seek causal-effect estimates should avoid analysing change scores and adopt alternative analytical strategies.},

One method that attempts to address this point entails relating the overall effect in every trial to summaries of patient characteristics. This is called meta-regression. The interpretation of such analyses is not straightforward, however, because of a combination of confounding and other biases. Much more useful is to compare the outcomes for patient subgroups within trials and combine these results across trials. Unfortunately this method is rarely possible using published information, so analyses of individual patient data from trials are necessary. Also, although meta-analyses generally summarise an intervention's effect as a relative risk reduction, the groups of patients with the greatest absolute risk reduction have the most to gain.},

We develop bias assessment, elicitation and adjustment methods, and apply them to a systematic review of longitudinal observational studies of the relationship between objectively measured physical activity and subsequent change in adiposity in children.Methods We separated internal biases that reflect study quality from external biases that reflect generalizability to a target setting. Since published results were presented in different formats, these were all converted to correlation coefficients. Biases were considered as additive or proportional on the correlation scale. Opinions about the extent of each bias in each study, together with its uncertainty, were elicited in a formal process from quantitatively trained assessors for the internal biases and subject-matter specialists for the external biases. Bias-adjusted results for each study were combined across assessors using median pooling, and results combined across studies by random-effects meta-analysis.Results Before adjusting for bias, the pooled correlation is difficult to interpret because the studies varied substantially in quality and design, and there was considerable heterogeneity. After adjusting for both the internal and external biases, the pooled correlation provides a meaningful quantitative summary of all available evidence, and the confidence interval incorporates the elicited uncertainties about the extent of the biases. In the adjusted meta-analysis, there was no apparent heterogeneity.Conclusion This approach provides a viable method of bias adjustment for meta-analyses of observational studies, allowing the quantitative synthesis of evidence from otherwise incompatible studies. From the meta-analysis of longitudinal observational studies, we conclude that there is no evidence that physical activity is associated with gain in body fat.},

Here we break down priority into two steps: disclosure, in which the discovery is released to the world-wide community; and validation, in which other scientists assess the accuracy, quality and importance of the work. Currently, in biology, disclosure and an initial validation are combined in a journal publication.

The STROBE Statement provides guidance to authors about how to improve the reporting of observational studies and facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of studies by reviewers, journal editors and readers. This explanatory and elaboration document is intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the STROBE Statement. The meaning and rationale for each checklist item are presented. For each item, one or several published examples and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature are provided.

  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is useful in assessing how robust an association is to potential unmeasured or uncontrolled confounding. This article introduces a new measure called the "E-value," which is related to the evidence for causality in observational studies that are potentially subject to confounding. The E-value is defined as the minimum strength of association, on the risk ratio scale, that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the treatment and the outcome to fully explain away a specific treatment-outcome association, conditional on the measured covariates. A large E-value implies that considerable unmeasured confounding would be needed to explain away an effect estimate. A small E-value implies little unmeasured confounding would be needed to explain away an effect estimate. The authors propose that in all observational studies intended to produce evidence for causality, the E-value be reported or some other sensitivity analysis be used. They suggest calculating the E-value for both the observed association estimate (after adjustments for measured confounders) and the limit of the confidence interval closest to the null. If this were to become standard practice, the ability of the scientific community to assess evidence from observational studies would improve considerably, and ultimately, science would be strengthened.},

In this paper, we derive optimal analytic conversions of odds ratios and hazard ratios to risk ratios that are minimax for the bias ratio when outcome probabilities are specified to fall in any fixed interval. The results for hazard ratios are derived under a proportional hazard assumption for the exposure. For outcome probabilities specified to lie in symmetric intervals centered around 0.5, it is shown that the square-root transformation of the odds ratio is the optimal minimax conversion for the risk ratio. General results for any nonsymmetric interval are given both for odds ratio and for hazard ratio conversions. The results are principally useful when odds ratios or hazard ratios are reported in papers, and the reader does not have access to the data or to information about the overall outcome prevalence.},

The authors were randomly allocated to the intervention (financial incentive with several contact approaches) or control group (using the same contact approaches). Studied outcomes are proportion of authors who provided IPD, time to obtain IPD, and completeness of IPD received. Results Of the 129 authors contacted, 37 authors suggested or contacted a person or funder providing relevant details or showed interest to collaborate, whereas 45 authors directed us to contact a person or funder, lacked resources or time, did not have ownership or approval to share the IPD, or claimed IPD was too old. None of the authors shared their IPD. We contacted 17 sponsors and received two complete IPD datasets from one sponsor. The time to obtain IPD was {$>$}1~year after a sponsor's positive response. Common barriers included study identification, data ownership, limited data access, and required IPD licenses. Conclusion IPD sharing may depend on study characteristics, including funding type, study size, study risk of bias, and treatment effect, but not on providing a financial incentive.},

The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalizability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case\textendash control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case\textendash control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

It is estimated that, from 1980 to 2000, reduction in total cholesterol accounted for a 33\% decrease in coronary heart disease (CHD) deaths in the United States. In other developed countries, similar decreases in CHD deaths (ranging from 19\%\textendash 46\%) have been attributed to reduction in total cholesterol. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has now largely replaced total cholesterol as a risk marker and the primary treatment target for hyperlipidemia.

Our evaluation focused on the development of study filters for NRS with a control group (``controlled NRS''), as this study type allows the calculation of an effect size. In addition, we assumed that due to the more explicit search syntax, controlled NRS are easier to identify than non-controlled ones, potentially resulting in better performance measures of study filters for controlled NRS. Our aim was to develop study filters for identifying controlled NRS in PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE. We developed two new search filters that can assist clinicians and researchers in identifying controlled NRS in PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE. The reference set was based on 2110 publications in Medline extracted from 271 Cochrane reviews and on 4333 irrelevant references. The first filter maximizes sensitivity (92.42\%; specificity 79.67\%, precision 68.49\%) and should be used when a comprehensive search is needed.

The objective of this study was to provide a comparative overview of validation results for various MEDLINE search filters. Study Design and Setting Search filters were tested for plausibility. A relative recall approach was used to generate a gold standard based on an overview of systematic reviews of qualitative studies. For each review, the included qualitative studies were collected and checked for MEDLINE-indexing. The body of indexed articles yielded the gold standard. Validation tests were conducted to determine whether the references of the gold standard could be identified with the respective search filters. Results Thirteen search filters were validated in MEDLINE. One search filter by Wong et~al. (2004) was found to be the most sensitive (93.63\%). While medical subject heading ``qualitative research'' achieved the best precision (2.15\%), sensitivity was the lowest (22.56\%). University of Texas provided the best balanced search filter with a sensitivity of 81.96\% and a precision of 0.80\%. Conclusion Search filters to identify qualitative research in MEDLINE differ greatly in design and performance.

Our research will focus on drugs used for the treatment of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and type 2 diabetes, all of which have previously been identified as potentially cerebroprotective and have variable levels of preclinical evidence that suggest they may have beneficial effects for various aspects of dementia pathology.Methods and analysis We will conduct a hypothesis testing observational cohort study using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Our analysis will consider four statistical methods, which have different approaches for modelling confounding. These are multivariable adjusted Cox regression; propensity matched regression; instrumental variable analysis and marginal structural models. We will also use an intention-to-treat analysis, whereby we will define all exposures based on the first prescription observed in the database so that the target parameter is comparable to that estimated by a randomised controlled trial.Ethics and dissemination This protocol has been approved by the CPRDs Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC). We will publish the results of the study as open-access peer-reviewed publications and disseminate findings through national and international conferences as are appropriate.},

  abstract = {Background:~         Hypertension in midlife is associated with increased risk of Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia late in life. In addition, some antihypertensive drugs have been proposed to have cognitive benefits, independent of their effect on hypertension. Consequently, there is potential to repurpose antihypertensive drugs for the prevention of dementia. This study systematically compared seven antihypertensive drug classes for this purpose, using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.         Methods:~         We assessed treatments for hypertension in an instrumental variable analysis to address potential confounding and reverse causation. We used physicians' prescribing preference as an ordinal instrument, defined by the physicians' last seven prescriptions. Participants considered were new antihypertensive users between 1996 and 2016, aged 40 and over.         Results:~         We analyzed 849,378 patients, with total follow up of 5,497,266 patient-years. We estimated that {$\beta$}-adrenoceptor blockers and vasodilator antihypertensives conferred small protective effects\textemdash for example, {$\beta$}-adrenoceptor blockers were associated with 13 (95\% confidence interval = 6, 20) fewer cases of any dementia per 1000 treated compared with other antihypertensives.         Conclusions:~         We estimated small differences in the effects of antihypertensive drug classes on dementia outcomes. We also show that the magnitude of the differences between drug classes is smaller than that previously reported. Future research should look to implement other causal analysis methods to address biases in conventional observational research, with the ultimate aim of triangulating the evidence concerning this hypothesis.},

This study aims to prospectively investigate the age- and sex-specific incidence density and relative hazards of AD in relation to diabetes. METHODS: A total of 615,529 diabetic patients and 614,871 age- and sex-matched random controls were linked to the claim data from 2000-2008 to identify the first occurrence of a primary or secondary diagnosis of AD. Incidence density was calculated under the Poisson assumption. We also assessed the age- and sex-specific risk of AD in relation to diabetes with the Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS: Over nearly 9 years of follow-up, a total of 4,615 diabetic subjects developed AD, representing a cumulative incidence rate of 0.75\% (n = 3,873; 0.63\% in controls). The overall incidence densities of AD for diabetic men and women, respectively, were 0.82 and 1.15 per 1,000 person-years, which were higher than those for control men and women (0.63 and 0.89 per 1,000 person-years, respectively). Diabetic patients had a significantly higher hazard ratio (HR) of AD [1.45, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.38-1.52]. Diabetic women {$\geq$}65 years had a higher HR (1.52, 95\% CI 1.42-1.62) than diabetic women {$<$}65 years (1.34, 95\% CI 1.15-1.56). CONCLUSION: Diabetes may increase the risk of AD in both sexes and in all ages. A higher HR of AD was especially notable in older diabetic women.},

This bias is a common challenge for studies of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) because AD neuropathology can only be identified through brain autopsy and is therefore not available for most study participants. Clinical AD diagnosis, although more widely available, has imperfect sensitivity and specificity relative to AD neuropathology. In this study we present a sensitivity analysis approach using a bias-adjusted discrete proportional hazards model to quantify robustness of results to misclassification of a time to event outcome and apply this method to data from a longitudinal panel study of AD. Using data on 1,955 participants from the Adult Changes in Thought study we analyzed the association between average glucose level and AD neuropathology and conducted sensitivity analyses to explore how estimated hazard ratios varied according to AD classification accuracy. Unadjusted hazard ratios were closer to the null than estimates obtained under most scenarios for misclassification investigated. Confidence interval estimates from the unadjusted model were substantially underestimated compared to adjusted estimates. This study demonstrates the importance of exploring outcome misclassification in time to event analyses and provides an approach that can be undertaken without requiring validation data.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if midlife cardiovascular risk factors are associated with risk of late-life dementia in a large, diverse cohort. METHOD: The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of 8,845 participants of a health maintenance organization who underwent health evaluations from 1964 to 1973 when they were between the ages of 40 and 44. Midlife cardiovascular risk factors included total cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking. Diagnoses of dementia were ascertained by medical records from January 1994 to April 2003. RESULTS: The authors identified 721 participants (8.2\%) with dementia. Smoking, hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes at midlife were each associated with a 20 to 40\% increase in risk of dementia (fully adjusted Cox proportional hazards model: HR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.04 to 1.48 for hypertension, HR 1.26, 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.47 for smoking, HR 1.42, 95\% CI 1.22 to 1.66 for high cholesterol, and HR 1.46, 95\% CI 1.19 to 1.79 for diabetes). A composite cardiovascular risk score was created using all four risk factors and was associated with dementia in a dose-dependent fashion. Compared with participants having no risk factors, the risk for dementia increased from 1.27 for having one risk factor to 2.37 for having all four risk factors (fully adjusted model: HR 2.37, 95\% CI 1.10 to 5.10). CONCLUSION: The presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors at midlife substantially increases risk of late-life dementia in a dose dependent manner.},

  abstract = {Background Studies investigating the prevention of weight gain differ considerably in design and quality, which impedes pooling them in conventional meta-analyses, the basis for evidence-based policy making. This study is aimed at quantifying the prospective association between measured physical activity and fat mass in children, using a meta-analysis method that allows inclusion of heterogeneous studies by adjusting for differences through eliciting and incorporating expert opinion. Methods Studies on prevention of weight gain using objectively measured exposure and outcome were eligible; they were adopted from a recently published systematic review. Differences in study quality and design were considered as internal and external biases and captured in checklists. Study results were converted to correlation coefficients and biases were considered either additive or proportional on this scale. The extent and uncertainty of biases in each study were elicited in a formal process by six quantitatively-trained assessors and five subject-matter specialists. Biases for each study were combined across assessors using median pooling. Results were combined across studies by random-effects meta-analysis. Results The combined correlation of the unadjusted results from the six studies was -0.04 (95\%CI: -0.22, 0.14) with considerable heterogeneity (I2 = 78\%), which makes it difficult to interpret the result. After bias-adjustment the pooled correlation was -0.01 (95\%CI: -0.18, 0.16) with apparent study compatibility (I2 = 0\%). Conclusion By using this method the prospective association between physical activity and fat mass could be quantitatively synthesized; the result suggests no association. Objectively measured physical activity may not be the key determinant of unhealthy weight gain in children.},

Its use in pharmacoepidemiology stretches back many years with now over 800 original research papers. Administered by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency since 2001, the last 5 years have seen a rebuild of the database processing system enhancing access to the data, and a concomitant push towards broadening the applications of the database. New methodologies including real-world harm\textendash benefit assessment, pharmacogenetic studies and pragmatic randomised controlled trials within the database are being implemented. A substantive and unique linkage program (using a trusted third party) has enabled access to secondary care data and disease-specific registry data as well as socio-economic data and death registration data. The utility of anonymised free text accessed in a safe and appropriate manner is being explored using simple and more complex techniques such as natural language processing.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine whether genetic variation affecting the expression or function of lipid-lowering drug targets is associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) risk, to evaluate the potential impact of long-term exposure to corresponding therapeutics. METHODS: We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses using variants in genes that encode the protein targets of several approved lipid-lowering drug classes: HMGCR (encoding the target for statins), PCSK9 (encoding the target for PCSK9 inhibitors, eg, evolocumab and alirocumab), NPC1L1 (encoding the target for ezetimibe), and APOB (encoding the target of mipomersen). Variants were weighted by associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) using data from lipid genetics consortia (n up to 295,826). We meta-analyzed Mendelian randomization estimates for regional variants weighted by LDL-C on AD risk from 2 large samples (total n = 24,718 cases, 56,685 controls). RESULTS: Models for HMGCR, APOB, and NPC1L1 did not suggest that the use of related lipid-lowering drug classes would affect AD risk. In contrast, genetically instrumented exposure to PCSK9 inhibitors was predicted to increase AD risk in both of the AD samples (combined odds ratio per standard deviation lower LDL-C inducible by the drug target = 1.45, 95\% confidence interval = 1.23-1.69). This risk increase was opposite to, although more modest than, the degree of protection from coronary artery disease predicted by these same methods for PCSK9 inhibition. INTERPRETATION: We did not identify genetic support for the repurposing of statins, ezetimibe, or mipomersen for AD prevention. Notwithstanding caveats to this genetic evidence, pharmacovigilance for AD risk among users of PCSK9 inhibitors may be warranted. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:30-39.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

Methods/Design Up-to-date data for England were drawn from multiple sources to identify prevalence of dementia by severity, patterns of health and social care service utilisation and their unit costs, levels of unpaid care and its economic impacts, and other costs of dementia. These data were used in a refined macrosimulation model to estimate annual per-person and aggregate costs of dementia. Results There are around 690~000 people with dementia in England, of whom 565~000 receive unpaid care or community care or live in a care home. Total annual cost of dementia in England is estimated to be \textsterling 24.2 billion in 2015, of which 42\% (\textsterling 10.1 billion) is attributable to unpaid care. Social care costs (\textsterling 10.2 billion) are three times larger than health care costs (\textsterling 3.8 billion). \textsterling 6.2 billion of the total social care costs are met by users themselves and their families, with \textsterling 4.0 billion (39.4\%) funded by government. Total annual costs of mild, moderate, and severe dementia are \textsterling 3.2 billion, \textsterling 6.9 billion, and \textsterling 14.1 billion, respectively. Average costs of mild, moderate, and severe dementia are \textsterling 24~400, \textsterling 27~450, and \textsterling 46~050, respectively, per person per year. Conclusions Dementia has huge economic impacts on people living with the illness, their carers, and society as a whole. Better support for people with dementia and their carers, as well as fair and efficient financing of social care services, are essential to address the current and future challenges of dementia.},

  abstract = {Background Trial and observational evidence is conflicting in terms of the association of blood lipids, atherosclerosis and statin use with dementia and cognitive impairment in the general population. It is uncertain whether the associations occur in stroke patients, who are at known higher risk of cognitive decline. This systematic review was to synthesize the evidence for these associations among stroke patients. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and trial registries were searched. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational cohort studies conducted among patients with stroke and reported on the association of blood lipids, atherosclerosis or statin use with dementia or cognitive impairment. Meta-analysis was conducted separately for crude and maximally adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs). Results Of 18,026 records retrieved, 56 studies (one RCT and 55 cohort studies) comprising 38,423 stroke patients were included. For coronary heart disease, the pooled OR of dementia and cognitive impairment was 1.32 (95\%CI 1.10\textendash 1.58, n = 15 studies, I2 = 0\%) and 1.23 (95\%CI 0.99\textendash 1.54, n = 14, I2 = 26.9\%), respectively. Peripheral artery disease was associated with dementia (OR 3.59, 95\%CI 1.47\textendash 8.76, n = 2, I2 = 0\%) and cognitive impairment (OR 2.70, 95\%CI 1.09\textendash 6.69, n = 1). For carotid stenosis, the pooled OR of dementia and cognitive impairment was 2.67 (95\%CI 0.83\textendash 8.62, n = 3, I2 = 77.9\%) and 3.34 (95\%CI 0.79\textendash 14.1, n = 4, I2 = 96.6\%), respectively. For post-stroke statin use, the pooled OR of dementia and cognitive impairment was 0.89 (95\%CI 0.65\textendash 1.21, n = 1) and 0.56 (95\%CI 0.46-0.69, n = 3, I2 = 0\%), respectively. No association was observed for hypercholesterolemia. These results were mostly consistent with adjusted ORs or HRs, which were reported from limited evidence. Conclusion Atherosclerosis was associated with an increased risk of post-stroke dementia. Post-stroke statin use was associated with decreased risk of cognitive impairment. To confirm whether or not statins confer advantages in the post-stroke population in terms of preventing cognitive decline over and above their known effectiveness in reducing risk of further vascular events, further stroke trials including cognitive assessment and observational analyses adjusted for key confounders, focusing on key subgroups or statin use patterns are required.},

Only two subjects were lost to the follow-up, during which period 103 subjects developed dementia. Morphologic examination of the brains of 89 subjects (86.4\%) was made by autopsy or CT. We made the initial diagnosis of dementia based on the DSM-III-R criteria, with the diagnoses of vascular dementia (VD) being based on the NINDS-AIREN criteria and Alzheimer's disease (AD) on the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. The incidence of VD and AD increased with age for both sexes. The age-adjusted total incidence (per 1,000 person-years) of dementia was 19.3 for men and 20.9 for women. The corresponding rates for VD were 12.2 for men and 9.0 for women, and for AD, 5.1 for men and 10.9 for women. Among the VD subjects whose brain morphology we examined, the most frequent type of stroke was multiple lacunar infarcts (42\%), but half these subjects lacked a stroke episode in their histories. Multivariate analysis showed that age, prior stroke episodes, systolic blood pressure, and alcohol consumption were significant independent risk factors for the occurrence of VD. In contrast, age and a low score on Hasegawa's dementia scale were significant risk factors for AD, and physical activity was a significant preventive factor for AD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Thirty-one eligible studies involving a total of 3332,706 participants with 184,666 incident cases were included in this meta-analysis. Statins use was associated with dementia risk decrement (relevant risk [RR]: 0.85; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.80\textendash 0.89). Subgroup analysis showed statins use was associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) (RR: 0.81; 95\% CI, 0.73\textendash 0.89) and non-AD dementia (RR: 0.81; 95\% CI, 0.73\textendash 0.89) risk decrement. Furthermore, statins use was associated with dementia risk decrement in female (RR: 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.80\textendash 0.98) and male (RR: 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.83\textendash 0.93).

Such methods have been in use for over 30 years and are increasingly employed in healthcare and clinical decision-making. In this article, we give an overview of the methodology used in DRMA. Methods We summarize the commonly used regression model and the pooled method in DRMA. We also use an example to illustrate how to employ a DRMA by these methods. Results Five regression models, linear regression, piecewise regression, natural polynomial regression, fractional polynomial regression, and restricted cubic spline regression, were illustrated in this article to fit the dose-response relationship. And two types of pooling approaches, that is, one-stage approach and two-stage approach are illustrated to pool the dose-response relationship across studies. The example showed similar results among these models. Conclusion Several dose-response meta-analysis methods can be used for investigating the relationship between exposure level and the risk of an outcome. However the methodology of DRMA still needs to be improved.},

  abstract = {Instrumental variable analysis is a widely used method to estimate causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. When the instruments, exposure and outcome are not measured in the same sample, Angrist and Krueger (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc.87 (1992) 328\textendash 336) suggested to use two-sample instrumental variable (TSIV) estimators that use sample moments from an instrument-exposure sample and an instrument-outcome sample. However, this method is biased if the two samples are from heterogeneous populations so that the distributions of the instruments are different. In linear structural equation models, we derive a new class of TSIV estimators that are robust to heterogeneous samples under the key assumption that the structural relations in the two samples are the same. The widely used two-sample two-stage least squares estimator belongs to this class. It is generally not asymptotically efficient, although we find that it performs similarly to the optimal TSIV estimator in most practical situations. We then attempt to relax the linearity assumption. We find that, unlike one-sample analyses, the TSIV estimator is not robust to misspecified exposure model. Additionally, to nonparametrically identify the magnitude of the causal effect, the noise in the exposure must have the same distributions in the two samples. However, this assumption is in general untestable because the exposure is not observed in one sample. Nonetheless, we may still identify the sign of the causal effect in the absence of homogeneity of the noise.},

It often remains unclear whether the risk factors are cause or consequence of disease, or whether the associations are the result of confounding. Genetic methods are useful to infer causality because genetic variants are present from birth and therefore unlikely to be confounded with environmental factors. We develop and apply a method (GSMR) that performs a multi-SNP Mendelian Randomization analysis using summary-level data from large genome-wide association studies (sample sizes of up to 405,072) to test the causal associations of BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, serum cholesterols, blood pressures, height and years of schooling (EduYears) with a range of common diseases. We identify a number of causal associations including a protective effect of LDL-cholesterol against type-2 diabetes (T2D) that might explain the side effects of statins on T2D, a protective effect of EduYears against Alzheimer's disease, and bidirectional associations with opposite effects (e.g. higher BMI increases the risk of T2D but the effect T2D of BMI is negative). HDL-cholesterol has a significant risk effect on age-related macular degeneration, and the effect size remains significant accounting for the other risk factors. Our study develops powerful tools to integrate summary data from large studies to infer causality, and provides important candidates to be prioritized for further studies in medical research and for drug discovery.},
