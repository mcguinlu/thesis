  abstract = {If smoking is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) but a smoker dies of another cause before developing or manifesting AD, smoking-related mortality may mask the relationship between smoking and AD. This phenomenon, referred to as competing risk, complicates efforts to model the effect of smoking on AD. Typical survival regression models assume that censorship from analysis is unrelated to an individual's probability of developing AD (i.e., that censoring is noninformative). However, if individuals who die before developing AD are younger than those who survive long enough to develop AD, and if they include a higher percentage of smokers than nonsmokers, the incidence of AD will appear to be higher in older individuals and in nonsmokers. Further, age-specific mortality rates are higher in smokers because they die earlier than nonsmokers. Therefore, if we fail to take into account the competing risk of death when we estimate the effect of smoking on AD, we bias the results and are really only comparing the incidence of AD in nonsmokers with that in the healthiest smokers. In this study, we demonstrate that the effect of smoking on AD differs in models that are and are not adjusted for competing risks.},

It is therefore important to understand and appraise their strengths and weaknesses. We developed ROBINS-I (``Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of Interventions''), a new tool for evaluating risk of bias in estimates of the comparative effectiveness (harm or benefit) of interventions from studies that did not use randomisation to allocate units (individuals or clusters of individuals) to comparison groups. The tool will be particularly useful to those undertaking systematic reviews that include non-randomised studies.$<$/p$>$},

  doi = {10/gfkdzd},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Synthesis of multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a systematic review can summarize the effects of individual outcomes and provide numerical answers about the effectiveness of interventions. Filtering of searches is time consuming, and no single method fulfills the principal requirements of speed with accuracy. Automation of systematic reviews is driven by a necessity to expedite the availability of current best evidence for policy and clinical decision-making. We developed Rayyan ( http://rayyan.qcri.org ), a free web and mobile app, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability. For the beta testing phase, we used two published Cochrane reviews in which included studies had been selected manually. Their searches, with 1030 records and 273 records, were uploaded to Rayyan. Different features of Rayyan were tested using these two reviews. We also conducted a survey of Rayyan's users and collected feedback through a built-in feature.
RESULTS: Pilot testing of Rayyan focused on usability, accuracy against manual methods, and the added value of the prediction feature. The "taster" review (273 records) allowed a quick overview of Rayyan for early comments on usability. The second review (1030 records) required several iterations to identify the previously identified 11 trials. The "suggestions" and "hints," based on the "prediction model," appeared as testing progressed beyond five included studies. Post rollout user experiences and a reflexive response by the developers enabled real-time modifications and improvements. The survey respondents reported 40\% average time savings when using Rayyan compared to others tools, with 34\% of the respondents reporting more than 50\% time savings. In addition, around 75\% of the respondents mentioned that screening and labeling studies as well as collaborating on reviews to be the two most important features of Rayyan. As of November 2016, Rayyan users exceed 2000 from over 60 countries conducting hundreds of reviews totaling more than 1.6M citations. Feedback from users, obtained mostly through the app web site and a recent survey, has highlighted the ease in exploration of searches, the time saved, and simplicity in sharing and comparing include-exclude decisions. The strongest features of the app, identified and reported in user feedback, were its ability to help in screening and collaboration as well as the time savings it affords to users.
CONCLUSIONS: Rayyan is responsive and intuitive in use with significant potential to lighten the load of reviewers.},

  doi = {10.1001/archneur.56.3.303},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subjects with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have a memory impairment beyond that expected for age and education yet are not demented. These subjects are becoming the focus of many prediction studies and early intervention trials.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize clinically subjects with MCI cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal inception cohort.
SETTING: General community clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 76 consecutively evaluated subjects with MCI were compared with 234 healthy control subjects and 106 patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD), all from a community setting as part of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Center/Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry, Rochester, Minn.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 3 groups of individuals were compared on demographic factors and measures of cognitive function including the Mini-Mental State Examination, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, Dementia Rating Scale, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, and Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Clinical classifications of dementia and AD were determined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria, respectively.
RESULTS: The primary distinction between control subjects and subjects with MCI was in the area of memory, while other cognitive functions were comparable. However, when the subjects with MCI were compared with the patients with very mild AD, memory performance was similar, but patients with AD were more impaired in other cognitive domains as well. Longitudinal performance demonstrated that the subjects with MCI declined at a rate greater than that of the controls but less rapidly than the patients with mild AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who meet the criteria for MCI can be differentiated from healthy control subjects and those with very mild AD. They appear to constitute a clinical entity that can be characterized for treatment interventions.},
