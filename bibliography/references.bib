  abstract = {Preprints have arrived. In increasing numbers, researchers across the life sciences are embracing the once-niche practice, shaking off decades of reluctance and posting hundreds of papers per week to preprint servers, sharing their findings with the community before embarking on the weary march through peer review. However, there are limited methods for individuals sifting through this avalanche of research to identify the preprints that are most relevant to their interests. Here, we describe Rxivist.org, a website that indexes all preprints posted to bioRxiv.org, the largest preprint server in the life sciences, and allows users to filter and sort papers based on download metrics and Twitter activity over a variety of categories and time periods. In this work, we hope to make it easier for readers to find relevant research on bioRxiv and to improve the visibility of preprints currently being read and discussed online.},

Cognitive performance (global cognitive functioning, visual memory, verbal fluency, psychomotor speed and executive function), clinical diagnosis of dementia, and fibrate and statin use, were evaluated at baseline, and 2, 4, and 7 year follow-up. Multivariate Cox models were stratified by gender and adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics, mental and physical health including vascular risk factors, and genetic vulnerability (apolipoprotein E and cholesteryl ester transfer protein). For women but not men, fibrate use was specifically associated with an increased risk over 7 years of decline in visual memory only (HR=1.29, 95\%CI=1.09\textendash 1.54, p=0.004), and did not increase risk for incident dementia. This association was independent of genetic vulnerability related to ApoE and Cholesteryl Exchange Transfer Protein polymorphisms and occurred only in women with higher LDL-cholesterol levels and treated with fibrate (HR=1.39, 95\%CI=1.08\textendash 1.79, p=0.01) and not in those with lower LDL-cholesterol levels irrespective of fibrate treatment. For both sexes, no significant associations were found between statins (irrespective of their lipophilicity) and either cognitive decline or dementia incidence. This prospective study, adjusting for multiple confounders, found no evidence that LLA given in late life reduced the risk of cognitive decline and dementia, but did raise the possibility that women with treatment-resistant high LDL-cholesterol may be at increased risk of decline in visual memory.},

  abstract = {Background Dementia includes a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive loss of cognitive function and a decrease in the ability to perform activities of daily living. Systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) focus on how well the index test detects patients with the disease in terms of figures such as sensitivity and specificity. Although DTA reviews about dementia are essential, at present there is no information about their quantity and quality. Methods We searched for DTA reviews in MEDLINE (1966\textendash 2013), EMBASE (1980\textendash 2013), The Cochrane Library (from its inception until December 2013) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE). Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the reviews using the AMSTAR measurement tool, and the quality of the reporting using the PRISMA checklist. We describe the main characteristics of these reviews, including basic characteristics, type of dementia, and diagnostic test evaluated, and we summarize the AMSTAR and PRISMA scores. Results We selected 24 DTA systematic reviews. Only 10 reviews (41.6\%), assessed the bias of included studies and few (33\%) used this information to report the review results or to develop their conclusions Only one review (4\%) reported all methodological items suggested by the PRISMA tool. Assessing methodology quality by means of the AMSTAR tool, we found that six DTA reviews (25\%) pooled primary data with the aid of methods that are used for intervention reviews, such as Mantel-Haenszel and separate random-effects models (25\%), while five reviews (20.8\%) assessed publication bias by means of funnel plots and/or Egger's Test. Conclusions Our assessment of these DTA reviews reveals that their quality, both in terms of methodology and reporting, is far from optimal. Assessing the quality of diagnostic evidence is fundamental to determining the validity of the operating characteristics of the index test and its usefulness in specific settings. The development of high quality DTA systematic reviews about dementia continues to be a challenge.

  abstract = {Background Lipid-lowering medications (LLMs) and especially statin drugs can delay cognitive decline and dementia onset in individuals with and without mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at baseline. Methods A longitudinal, observational study was conducted of 3069 cognitively healthy elderly patients ({$\geq$}75 years of age) who were enrolled in the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory Study. The primary outcome measure was the time to adjudicated all-cause dementia and Alzheimer dementia (AD). The secondary outcome measure was the change in global cognitive function over time measured by scores from the Modified Mini-Mental State Exam (3MSE) and the cognitive subscale of the AD Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog). Results Among participants without MCI at baseline, the current use of statins was consistently associated with a reduced risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 0.65-0.96; P = .021) and AD (HR, 0.57; 95\% CI, 0.39-0.85; P = .005). In participants who initiated statin therapy, lipophilic statins tended to reduce dementia risk more than nonlipophilic agents. In contrast, there was no significant association between LLM use (including statins), dementia onset, or cognitive decline in individuals with baseline MCI. However, in individuals without MCI at baseline, there was a trend for a neuroprotective effect of statins on cognitive decline. Conclusions Statins may slow the rate of cognitive decline and delay the onset of AD and all-cause dementia in cognitively healthy elderly individuals, whereas individuals with MCI may not have comparable cognitive protection from these agents. However, the results from this observational study need to be interpreted with caution and will require confirmation by randomized clinical trials stratifying treatment groups based on MCI status at baseline.},

The role of perceptual impairments in sensorimotor function is unclear, and has typically been studied in single-joint motions. Research Question: We hypothesized that perception of whole-body motion is impaired in PD and contributes to balance impairments. We tested 1) whether directional acuity to whole body perturbations during standing was worse in people with PD compared to neurotypical older adults (NOA), and 2) whether balance ability, as assessed by the MiniBESTest, was associated with poor directional acuity in either group.                                   Methods             Participants were exposed to pairs of support-surface translation perturbations in a two-alternative forced choice testing paradigm developed previously in a young healthy population. The first perturbation of each pair was directly backward and the second deviated to the left or right (1\textdegree\textendash 44\textdegree ). Participants judged and reported whether the perturbations in each pair were in the ``same'' or ``different'' direction. This information was used to calculate directional acuity thresholds corresponding to ``just-noticeable differences'' in perturbation direction. Linear mixed models determined associations between directional thresholds and clinical variables including MDS UPDRS-III score, age, and MiniBESTest score. Results: 20 PD (64{$\pm$}7 y, 12 male, {$\geqslant$}12 hours since last intake of antiparkinsonian medications) and 12 NOA (64{$\pm$}8, 6 male) were assessed. Directional thresholds were higher (worse) among PD participants (17.6{$\pm$}5.9\textdegree{} vs. 12.8{$\pm$}3.3\textdegree, P{$<$}0.01). Linear mixed models further showed that higher thresholds were associated with MDS UPDRS-III score (P{$<$}0.01), and were associated with poorer balance ability among PD participants (P{$<$}0.01), but not among NOA participants (P=0.40). Significance: Perception of whole-body motion is impaired in PD and may contribute to impaired balance and falls.},

Design Meta-analysis. Data sources and study selection All of the 195 registered and completed reviews (status from the PROSPERO registry) with associated publications at the time of our search (1 July 2014). Data extraction All authors extracted data using registry entries and publication information related to the data sources used, the number of initially retrieved citations, the final number of included studies, the time between registration date to publication date and number of authors involved for completion of each publication. Information related to funding and geographical location was also recorded when reported. Results The mean estimated time to complete the project and publish the review was 67.3 weeks (IQR=42). The number of studies found in the literature searches ranged from 27 to 92 020; the mean yield rate of included studies was 2.94\% (IQR=2.5); and the mean number of authors per review was 5, SD=3. Funded reviews took significantly longer to complete and publish (mean=42 vs 26 weeks) and involved more authors and team members (mean=6.8 vs 4.8 people) than those that did not report funding (both p{$<$}0.001). Conclusions Systematic reviews presently take much time and require large amounts of human resources. In the light of the ever-increasing volume of published studies, application of existing computing and informatics technology should be applied to decrease this time and resource burden. We discuss recently published guidelines that provide a framework to make finding and accessing relevant literature less burdensome.},

The lessons from these analyses are likely to be highly relevant when it comes to lipidomics and the analyses of lipid subspecies whose biology is less well understood. Recent findings Although analyses of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and lipoprotein(a) are unambiguous as there are genetic variants that associate exclusively with these risk factors and have well-understood biology, analyses for triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) are less clear. For example, a subset of genetic variants having specific associations with HDL-c are not associated with CHD risk, but an allele score including all variants associated with HDL-c does associate with CHD risk. Recently developed methods, such as multivariable MR, MR-Egger, and a weighted median method, suggest that the relationship between HDL-c and CHD risk is null, thus confirming experimental evidence. Summary Robust methods for MR have important utility for understanding the causal relationships between major lipids and CHD risk, and are likely to play an important role in judging the causal relevance of lipid subspecies and other metabolites measured on high-dimensional phenotyping platforms.},

Methods               Using data from a prospective cohort study in the Netherlands, we conceptualized a sequence of ``trials'' in which eligible individuals ages 55\textendash 80 years were classified as statin initiators or noninitiators for every consecutive month between 1993 and 2007 and were followed until diagnosis of dementia, death, loss to follow-up, or the end of follow-up. We estimated 2 types of effects of statin use on dementia and a combined endpoint of dementia or death: the effect of initiation vs no initiation and the effect of sustained use vs no use. We estimated risk by statin treatment strategy over time via pooled logistic regression. We used inverse-probability weighting to account for treatment-confounder feedback in estimation of per-protocol effects.                                         Results               Of 233,526 eligible person-trials (6,373 individuals), there were 622 initiators and 232,904 noninitiators. Comparing statin initiation with no initiation, the 10-year risk differences (95\% confidence interval) were -0.1\% (-2.3\% to 1.8\%) for dementia and 0.3\% (-2.7\% to 3.3\%) for dementia or death. Comparing sustained statin use vs no use, the 10-year risk differences were -2.2\% (-5.2\% to 1.6\%) for dementia and -5.1\% (-10.5\% to -1.1\%) for dementia or death.                                         Conclusions               Individuals with sustained statin use, but not statin initiation alone, had reduced 10-year risks of dementia and dementia or death. Our results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of initiators and events and potential for residual confounding.},

Mediation analysis experiences a number of methodological difficulties, including bias due to confounding and measurement error. Mendelian randomisation (MR) can be used to improve causal inference for mediation analysis. We describe two approaches that can be used for estimating mediation analysis with MR: multivariable Mendelian randomisation (MVMR) and two-step Mendelian randomisation. We outline the approaches and provide code to demonstrate how they can be used in mediation analysis. We review issues that can affect analyses, including confounding, measurement error, weak instrument bias, and analysis of multiple mediators. Description of the methods is supplemented by simulated and real data examples. Although Mendelian randomisation relies on large sample sizes and strong assumptions, such as having strong instruments and no horizontally pleiotropic pathways, our examples demonstrate that it is unlikely to be affected by confounders of the exposure or mediator and the outcome, reverse causality and non-differential measurement error of the exposure or mediator. Both MVMR and two-step MR can be implemented in both individual-level MR and summary data MR, and can improve causal inference in mediation analysis.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {If smoking is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) but a smoker dies of another cause before developing or manifesting AD, smoking-related mortality may mask the relationship between smoking and AD. This phenomenon, referred to as competing risk, complicates efforts to model the effect of smoking on AD. Typical survival regression models assume that censorship from analysis is unrelated to an individual's probability of developing AD (i.e., that censoring is noninformative). However, if individuals who die before developing AD are younger than those who survive long enough to develop AD, and if they include a higher percentage of smokers than nonsmokers, the incidence of AD will appear to be higher in older individuals and in nonsmokers. Further, age-specific mortality rates are higher in smokers because they die earlier than nonsmokers. Therefore, if we fail to take into account the competing risk of death when we estimate the effect of smoking on AD, we bias the results and are really only comparing the incidence of AD in nonsmokers with that in the healthiest smokers. In this study, we demonstrate that the effect of smoking on AD differs in models that are and are not adjusted for competing risks.},

The recent American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines on lipid management emphasize treatment of individuals at increased risk for developing CVD events with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) at doses proven to reduce CVD events. However, there are limited options for patients who are either intolerant to statin therapy, develop CVD despite being on maximally tolerated statin therapy, or have severe hypercholesterolemia. Recently the Food and Drug Administration approved two novel medications for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol reduction: Evolocumab and Alirocumab. These agents target and inactivate proprotein convertase subtilsin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a hepatic protease that attaches and internalizes LDL receptors into lysosomes hence promoting their destruction. By preventing LDL receptor destruction, LDL-C levels can be lowered 50\%-60\% above that achieved by statin therapy alone. This review explores PCSK-9 biology and the mechanisms available to alter it; clinical trials targeting PCSK9 activity, and the current state of clinically available inhibitors of PCSK9.},

  abstract = {An omnibus index offers a single summary expression for a fourfold table of binary concordance among two observers. Among the available other omnibus indexes, none offers a satisfactory solution for the paradoxes that occur with p0 and kappa. The problem can be avoided only by using ppos and pneg as two separate indexes of proportionate agreement in the observers' positive and negative decisions. These two indexes, which are analogous to sensitivity and specificity for concordance in a diagnostic marker test, create the paradoxes formed when the chance correction in kappa is calculated as a product of the increment in the two indexes and the increment in marginal totals. If only a single omnibus index is used to compared different performances in observer variability, the paradoxes of kappa are desirable since they appropriately "penalize" inequalities in ppos and pneg. For better understanding of results and for planning improvements in the observers' performance, however, the omnibus value of kappa should always be accompanied by separate individual values of ppos and pneg.},

  abstract = {In epidemiologic cohort studies of chronic diseases, such as heart disease or cancer, confounding by age can bias the estimated effects of risk factors under study. With Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling in such studies, it would generally be recommended that chronological age be handled nonparametrically as the primary time scale. However, studies involving baseline measurements of biomarkers or other factors frequently use follow-up time since measurement as the primary time scale, with no explicit justification. The effects of age are adjusted for by modeling age at entry as a parametric covariate. Parametric adjustment raises the question of model adequacy, in that it assumes a known functional relationship between age and disease, whereas using age as the primary time scale does not. We illustrate this graphically and show intuitively why the parametric approach to age adjustment using follow-up time as the primary time scale provides a poor approximation to age-specific incidence. Adequate parametric adjustment for age could require extensive modeling, which is wasteful, given the simplicity of using age as the primary time scale. Furthermore, the underlying hazard with follow-up time based on arbitrary timing of study initiation may have no inherent meaning in terms of risk. Given the potential for biased risk estimates, age should be considered as the preferred time scale for proportional-hazards regression with epidemiologic follow-up data when confounding by age is a concern.},

  abstract = {Objectives Appropriate reporting is central to the application of findings from research to clinical practice. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations consist of a checklist of 22 items that provide guidance on the reporting of cohort, case\textendash control and cross-sectional studies, in order to facilitate critical appraisal and interpretation of results. STROBE was published in October 2007 in several journals including The Lancet, BMJ, Annals of Internal Medicine and PLoS Medicine. Within the framework of the revision of the STROBE recommendations, the authors examined the context and circumstances in which the STROBE statement was used in the past. Design The authors searched the Web of Science database in August 2010 for articles which cited STROBE and examined a random sample of 100 articles using a standardised, piloted data extraction form. The use of STROBE in observational studies and systematic reviews (including meta-analyses) was classified as appropriate or inappropriate. The use of STROBE to guide the reporting of observational studies was considered appropriate. Inappropriate uses included the use of STROBE as a tool to assess the methodological quality of studies or as a guideline on how to design and conduct studies. Results The authors identified 640 articles that cited STROBE. In the random sample of 100 articles, about half were observational studies (32\%) or systematic reviews (19\%). Comments, editorials and letters accounted for 15\%, methodological articles for 8\%, and recommendations and narrative reviews for 26\% of articles. Of the 32 observational studies, 26 (81\%) made appropriate use of STROBE, and three uses (10\%) were considered inappropriate. Among 19 systematic reviews, 10 (53\%) used STROBE inappropriately as a tool to assess study quality. Conclusions The STROBE reporting recommendations are frequently used inappropriately in systematic reviews and meta-analyses as an instrument to assess the methodological quality of observational studies.},

  abstract = {Introduction Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing public health concern affecting millions of patients worldwide and costing billions of dollars annually. We review the pipeline of drugs and biologics in clinical trials for the treatment of AD. We use the Common Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Research Ontology (CADRO) to classify treatment targets and mechanisms of action. We review our annual pipeline reports for the past 5 years to provide longitudinal insight into clinical trials and drug development for AD. Methods We reviewed ClinicalTrials.gov as of February 27, 2020, and identified all trials of pharmacologic agents currently being developed for treatment of AD as represented on this widely used U.S. Food and Drug Administration registry. Results There are 121 agents in clinical trials for the treatment of AD. Twenty-nine agents are in 36 Phase 3 trials, 65 agents are in 73 Phase 2 trials, and 27 agents are in 27 Phase 1 trials. Twelve agents in trials target cognitive enhancement and 12 are intended to treat neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms. There are 97 agents in disease modification trials. Compared to the 2019 pipeline, there is an increase in the number of disease-modifying agents targeting pathways other than amyloid or tau. Discussion The 2020 pipeline has innovations in clinical trials and treatment targets that provide hope for greater success in AD drug development programs. Review of clinical trials over the past 5 years show that there is progressive emphasis on non-amyloid targets, including candidate treatments for inflammation, synapse and neuronal protection, vascular factors, neurogenesis, and epigenetic interventions. There has been a marked growth in repurposed agents in the pipeline.},

This progress provides the impetus for our proposal of revised diagnostic criteria for AD. Our framework was developed to capture both the earliest stages, before full-blown dementia, as well as the full spectrum of the illness. These new criteria are centred on a clinical core of early and significant episodic memory impairment. They stipulate that there must also be at least one or more abnormal biomarkers among structural neuroimaging with MRI, molecular neuroimaging with PET, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis of amyloid {$\beta$} or tau proteins. The timeliness of these criteria is highlighted by the many drugs in development that are directed at changing pathogenesis, particularly at the production and clearance of amyloid {$\beta$} as well as at the hyperphosphorylation state of tau. Validation studies in existing and prospective cohorts are needed to advance these criteria and optimise their sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Aims: To appraise the clinical and genetic evidence that low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) cause atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Methods and results: We assessed whether the association between LDL and ASCVD fulfils the criteria for causality by evaluating the totality of evidence from genetic studies, prospective epidemiologic cohort studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and randomized trials of LDL-lowering therapies. In clinical studies, plasma LDL burden is usually estimated by determination of plasma LDL cholesterol level (LDL-C). Rare genetic mutations that cause reduced LDL receptor function lead to markedly higher LDL-C and a dose-dependent increase in the risk of ASCVD, whereas rare variants leading to lower LDL-C are associated with a correspondingly lower risk of ASCVD. Separate meta-analyses of over 200 prospective cohort studies, Mendelian randomization studies, and randomized trials including more than 2 million participants with over 20 million person-years of follow-up and over 150\,000 cardiovascular events demonstrate a remarkably consistent dose-dependent log-linear association between the absolute magnitude of exposure of the vasculature to LDL-C and the risk of ASCVD; and this effect appears to increase with increasing duration of exposure to LDL-C. Both the naturally randomized genetic studies and the randomized intervention trials consistently demonstrate that any mechanism of lowering plasma LDL particle concentration should reduce the risk of ASCVD events proportional to the absolute reduction in LDL-C and the cumulative duration of exposure to lower LDL-C, provided that the achieved reduction in LDL-C is concordant with the reduction in LDL particle number and that there are no competing deleterious off-target effects. Conclusion: Consistent evidence from numerous and multiple different types of clinical and genetic studies unequivocally establishes that LDL causes ASCVD.},

However, single trials are typically underpowered for exploring whether participant characteristics, such as age or disease severity, determine an individual's response to treatment. A meta-analysis of multiple trials, particularly one where individual participant data (IPD) are available, provides greater power to investigate interactions between participant characteristics (covariates) and treatment effects. We use a published IPD meta-analysis to illustrate three broad approaches used for testing such interactions. Based on another systematic review of recently published IPD meta-analyses, we also show that all three approaches can be applied to aggregate data as well as IPD. We also summarise which methods of analysing and presenting interactions are in current use, and describe their advantages and disadvantages. We recommend that testing for interactions using within-trials information alone (the deft approach) becomes standard practice, alongside graphical presentation that directly visualises this.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The virus underlying the COVID-19 disease, SARS-CoV-2, has caused over 3.2 million confirmed cases and 220,000 deaths between January and April 2020. Although the last pandemic of respiratory disease of viral origin swept the globe only a decade ago, the way science operates and responds to current events has experienced a paradigm shift in the interim. The scientific community has responded rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic, releasing over 16,000 COVID-19 related scientific articles within 4 months of the first confirmed case, of which at least 6,000 were hosted by preprint servers. We focused our analysis on bioRxiv and medRxiv, two growing preprint servers for biomedical research, investigating the attributes of COVID-19 preprints, their access and usage rates, characteristics of their sharing on online platforms, and the relationship between preprints and their published articles. Our data provides evidence for increased scientific and public engagement (COVID-19 preprints are accessed and distributed at least 15 times more than non-COVID-19 preprints) and changes in journalistic practice with reference to preprints. We also find evidence for changes in preprinting and publishing behaviour: COVID-19 preprints are shorter, with fewer panels and tables, and reviewed faster. Our results highlight the unprecedented role of preprints and preprint servers in the dissemination of COVID-19 science, and the likely long-term impact of the pandemic on the scientific publishing landscape.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background Despite substantial research and development investment in Alzheimer's disease (AD), effective therapeutics remain elusive. Significant emerging evidence has linked cholesterol, {$\beta$}-amyloid and AD, and several studies have shown a reduced risk for AD and dementia in populations treated with statins. However, while some clinical trials evaluating statins in general AD populations have been conducted, these resulted in no significant therapeutic benefit. By focusing on subgroups of the AD population, it may be possible to detect endotypes responsive to statin therapy. Methods Here we investigate the possible protective and therapeutic effect of statins in AD through the analysis of datasets of integrated clinical trials, and prospective observational studies. Results Re-analysis of AD patient-level data from failed clinical trials suggested by trend that use of simvastatin may slow the progression of cognitive decline, and to a greater extent in ApoE4 homozygotes. Evaluation of continual long-term use of various statins, in participants from multiple studies at baseline, revealed better cognitive performance in statin users. These findings were supported in an additional, observational cohort where the incidence of AD was significantly lower in statin users, and ApoE4/ApoE4-genotyped AD patients treated with statins showed better cognitive function over the course of 10-year follow-up. Conclusions These results indicate that the use of statins may benefit all AD patients with potentially greater therapeutic efficacy in those homozygous for ApoE4.},

This paper explores the origin of these limitations, and introduces an alternative and more stable agreement coefficient referred to as the AC1 coefficient. Also proposed are new variance estimators for the multiple-rater generalized {$\pi$} and AC1 statistics, whose validity does not depend upon the hypothesis of independence between raters. This is an improvement over existing alternative variances, which depend on the independence assumption. A Monte-Carlo simulation study demonstrates the validity of these variance estimators for confidence interval construction, and confirms the value of AC1 as an improved alternative to existing inter-rater reliability statistics.},

  abstract = {Cholinergic synapses are ubiquitous in the human central nervous system. Their high density in the thalamus, striatum, limbic system, and neocortex suggest that cholinergic transmission is likely to be critically important for memory, learning, attention and other higher brain functions. Several lines of research suggest additional roles for cholinergic systems in overall brain homeostasis and plasticity. As such, the brain's cholinergic system occupies a central role in ongoing research related to normal cognition and age-related cognitive decline, including dementias such as Alzheimer's disease. The cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease centres on the progressive loss of limbic and neocortical cholinergic innervation. Neurofibrillary degeneration in the basal forebrain is believed to be the primary cause for the dysfunction and death of forebrain cholinergic neurons, giving rise to a widespread presynaptic cholinergic denervation. Cholinesterase inhibitors increase the availability of acetylcholine at synapses in the brain and are one of the few drug therapies that have been proven clinically useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease dementia, thus validating the cholinergic system as an important therapeutic target in the disease. This review includes an overview of the role of the cholinergic system in cognition and an updated understanding of how cholinergic deficits in Alzheimer's disease interact with other aspects of disease pathophysiology, including plaques composed of amyloid-{$\beta$} proteins. This review also documents the benefits of cholinergic therapies at various stages of Alzheimer's disease and during long-term follow-up as visualized in novel imaging studies. The weight of the evidence supports the continued value of cholinergic drugs as a standard, cornerstone pharmacological approach in Alzheimer's disease, particularly as we look ahead to future combination therapies that address symptoms as well as disease progression.},

In such populations, therefore, reducing LDL cholesterol may reduce the development of vascular disease, largely irrespective of initial cholesterol concentrations.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}20 536 UK adults (aged 40\textendash 80 years) with coronary disease, other occlusive arterial disease, or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily (average compliance: 85\%) or matching placebo (average non-study statin use: 17\%). Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These "intention-to-treat" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85\% minus 17\%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12{$\cdot$}9\%] deaths among 10 269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14{$\cdot$}7\%] among 10 267 allocated placebo; p=0{$\cdot$}0003), due to a highly significant 18\% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5{$\cdot$}7\%] \emph{vs} 707 [6{$\cdot$}9\%]; p=0{$\cdot$}0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1{$\cdot$}9\%] \emph{vs} 230 [2{$\cdot$}2\%]; p=0{$\cdot$}07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5{$\cdot$}3\%] \emph{vs} 570 [5{$\cdot$}6\%]; p=0{$\cdot$}4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8{$\cdot$}7\%] \emph{vs} 1212 [11{$\cdot$}8\%]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4{$\cdot$}3\%] \emph{vs} 585 [5{$\cdot$}7\%]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001), and for coronary or noncoronary revascularisation (939 [9{$\cdot$}1\%] \emph{vs} 1205 [11{$\cdot$}7\%]; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24\% (SE 3; 95\% CI 19\textendash 28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19{$\cdot$}8\%] \emph{vs} 2585 [25{$\cdot$}2\%] affected individuals; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and\textemdash most notably\textemdash even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5{$\cdot$}0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0{$\cdot$}01\%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70\textendash 100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Synthesis of evidence from the totality of relevant research is essential to inform and improve prevention efforts and policy. Given the large and usually heterogeneous evidence available, reaching a thorough understanding of what works, for whom, and in what contexts, can only be achieved through a systematic and comprehensive synthesis of evidence. Many barriers impede comprehensive evidence synthesis, which leads to uncertainty about the generalizability of intervention effectiveness, including: inaccurate terminology titles/abstracts/keywords (hampering literature search efforts); ambiguous reporting of study methods (resulting in inaccurate assessments of study rigor); and poorly reported participant characteristics, outcomes, and key variables (obstructing the calculation of an overall effect or the examination of effect modifiers). To address these issues and improve the reach of primary studies through their inclusion in evidence syntheses, we provide a set of practical guidelines to help prevention scientists prepare synthesis-ready research. We use a recent mindfulness trial as an empirical example to ground the discussion and demonstrate ways to ensure: (1) primary studies are discoverable; (2) the types of data needed for synthesis are present; and (3) these data are readily synthesizable. We highlight several tools and practices that can aid authors in these efforts, such as creating a repository for each project to host all study-related data files. We also provide step-by-step guidance and software suggestions for standardizing data design and public archiving to facilitate synthesis-ready research.},

Design Prospective open cohort study with routinely collected data from general practice, 1 January 1993 to 31 March 2008. Setting 531 practices in England and Wales contributing to the national QRESEARCH database. Participants 2.3 million patients aged 35-74 (over 16 million person years) with 140 000 cardiovascular events. Overall population (derivation and validation cohorts) comprised 2.22 million people who were white or whose ethnic group was not recorded, 22 013 south Asian, 11 595 black African, 10 402 black Caribbean, and 19 792 from Chinese or other Asian or other ethnic groups. Main outcome measures First (incident) diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, stroke, and transient ischaemic attack) recorded in general practice records or linked Office for National Statistics death certificates. Risk factors included self assigned ethnicity, age, sex, smoking status, systolic blood pressure, ratio of total serum cholesterol:high density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, family history of coronary heart disease in first degree relative under 60 years, Townsend deprivation score, treated hypertension, type 2 diabetes, renal disease, atrial fibrillation, and rheumatoid arthritis. Results The validation statistics indicated that QRISK2 had improved discrimination and calibration compared with the modified Framingham score. The QRISK2 algorithm explained 43\% of the variation in women and 38\% in men compared with 39\% and 35\%, respectively, by the modified Framingham score. Of the 112 156 patients classified as high risk (that is, {$\geq$}20\% risk over 10 years) by the modified Framingham score, 46 094 (41.1\%) would be reclassified at low risk with QRISK2. The 10 year observed risk among these reclassified patients was 16.6\% (95\% confidence interval 16.1\% to 17.0\%)\textemdash that is, below the 20\% treatment threshold. Of the 78 024 patients classified at high risk on QRISK2, 11 962 (15.3\%) would be reclassified at low risk by the modified Framingham score. The 10 year observed risk among these patients was 23.3\% (22.2\% to 24.4\%)\textemdash that is, above the 20\% threshold. In the validation cohort, the annual incidence rate of cardiovascular events among those with a QRISK2 score of {$\geq$}20\% was 30.6 per 1000 person years (29.8 to 31.5) for women and 32.5 per 1000 person years (31.9 to 33.1) for men. The corresponding figures for the modified Framingham equation were 25.7 per 1000 person years (25.0 to 26.3) for women and 26.4 (26.0 to 26.8) for men). At the 20\% threshold, the population identified by QRISK2 was at higher risk of a CV event than the population identified by the Framingham score. Conclusions Incorporating ethnicity, deprivation, and other clinical conditions into the QRISK2 algorithm for risk of cardiovascular disease improves the accuracy of identification of those at high risk in a nationally representative population. At the 20\% threshold, QRISK2 is likely to be a more efficient and equitable tool for treatment decisions for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. As the validation was performed in a similar population to the population from which the algorithm was derived, it potentially has a ``home advantage.'' Further validation in other populations is therefore advised.},

Setting 368 general practices in England and Wales supplying data to the QResearch database. Participants 2 004 692 patients aged 30-84 years of whom 225 922 (10.7\%) were new users of statins: 159 790 (70.7\%) were prescribed simvastatin, 50 328 (22.3\%) atorvastatin, 8103 (3.6\%) pravastatin, 4497 (1.9\%) rosuvastatin, and 3204 (1.4\%) fluvastatin. Methods Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate effects of statin type, dose, and duration of use. The number needed to treat (NNT) or number needed to harm (NNH) was calculated and numbers of additional or fewer cases estimated for 10 000 treated patients. Main outcome measure First recorded occurrence of cardiovascular disease, moderate or serious myopathic events, moderate or serious liver dysfunction, acute renal failure, venous thromboembolism, Parkinson's disease, dementia, rheumatoid arthritis, cataract, osteoporotic fracture, gastric cancer, oesophageal cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, renal cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer. Results Individual statins were not significantly associated with risk of Parkinson's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, venous thromboembolism, dementia, osteoporotic fracture, gastric cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, renal cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer. Statin use was associated with decreased risks of oesophageal cancer but increased risks of moderate or serious liver dysfunction, acute renal failure, moderate or serious myopathy, and cataract. Adverse effects were similar across statin types for each outcome except liver dysfunction where risks were highest for fluvastatin. A dose-response effect was apparent for acute renal failure and liver dysfunction. All increased risks persisted during treatment and were highest in the first year. After stopping treatment the risk of cataract returned to normal within a year in men and women. Risk of oesophageal cancer returned to normal within a year in women and within 1-3 years in men. Risk of acute renal failure returned to normal within 1-3 years in men and women, and liver dysfunction within 1-3 years in women and from three years in men. Based on the 20\% threshold for cardiovascular risk, for women the NNT with any statin to prevent one case of cardiovascular disease over five years was 37 (95\% confidence interval 27 to 64) and for oesophageal cancer was 1266 (850 to 3460) and for men the respective values were 33 (24 to 57) and 1082 (711 to 2807). In women the NNH for an additional case of acute renal failure over five years was 434 (284 to 783), of moderate or severe myopathy was 259 (186 to 375), of moderate or severe liver dysfunction was 136 (109 to 175), and of cataract was 33 (28 to 38). Overall, the NNHs and NNTs for men were similar to those for women, except for myopathy where the NNH was 91 (74 to 112). Conclusions Claims of unintended benefits of statins, except for oesophageal cancer, remain unsubstantiated, although potential adverse effects at population level were confirmed and quantified. Further studies are needed to develop utilities to individualise the risks so that patients at highest risk of adverse events can be monitored closely.},

  abstract = {Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) exemplifies a population-level data source for generating real-world evidence to support clinical decisions and health care policy-making. Like with all claims databases, there have been some validity concerns of studies using the NHIRD, such as the accuracy of diagnosis codes and issues around unmeasured confounders. Endeavors to validate diagnosed codes or to develop methodologic approaches to address unmeasured confounders have largely increased the reliability of NHIRD studies. Recently, Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) established a Health and Welfare Data Center (HWDC), a data repository site that centralizes the NHIRD and about 70 other health-related databases for data management and analyses. To strengthen the protection of data privacy, investigators are required to conduct on-site analysis at an HWDC through remote connection to MOHW servers. Although the tight regulation of this on-site analysis has led to inconvenience for analysts and has increased time and costs required for research, the HWDC has created opportunities for enriched dimensions of study by linking across the NHIRD and other databases. In the near future, researchers will have greater opportunity to distill knowledge from the NHIRD linked to hospital-based electronic medical records databases containing unstructured patient-level information by using artificial intelligence techniques, including machine learning and natural language processes. We believe that NHIRD with multiple data sources could represent a powerful research engine with enriched dimensions and could serve as a guiding light for real-world evidence-based medicine in Taiwan.},

  abstract = {The time it takes for a completed manuscript to be published traditionally can be extremely lengthy. Article publication delay, which occurs in part due to constraints associated with peer review, can prevent the timely dissemination of critical and actionable data associated with new information on rare diseases or developing health concerns such as Zika virus. Preprint servers are open access online repositories housing preprint research articles that enable authors (1) to make their research immediately and freely available and (2) to receive commentary and peer review prior to journal submission. There is a growing movement of preprint advocates aiming to change the current journal publication and peer review system, proposing that preprints catalyze biomedical discovery, support career advancement, and improve scientific communication. While the number of articles submitted to and hosted by preprint servers are gradually increasing, there has been no simple way to identify biomedical research published in a preprint format, as they are not typically indexed and are only discoverable by directly searching the specific preprint server websites. To address this issue, we created a search engine that quickly compiles preprints from disparate host repositories and provides a one-stop search solution. Additionally, we developed a web application that bolsters the discovery of preprints by enabling each and every word or phrase appearing on any web site to be integrated with articles from preprint servers. This tool, search.bioPreprint, is publicly available at               http://www.hsls.pitt.edu/resources/preprint               .},

  abstract = {\emph{Background/Aims:} Cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) describes individuals whose cognitive functioning falls below normal but who do not meet dementia criteria. An important goal within CIND is to identify subgroups that will predictably progress to Alzheimer disease. CIND with amnestic deficits has been associated with high risk of Alzheimer disease but has until now been investigated on a retrospective basis. In this study a prospectively defined amnestic CIND group was characterized on a detailed neuropsychological test battery and on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures. \emph{Methods:} Amnestic CIND was defined as meeting at least 1 but not all DSM-IV-TR criteria for dementia, scoring {$\geqq$}1 SD below norms on Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall, having a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5 and a Mini-Mental State Exam score {$\geqq$}24. This cross-sectional study compared subjects meeting these criteria (n = 25) to age- and education-matched controls (n = 26). The neuropsychological battery included memory and nonmemory measures that were analyzed as continuous variables and dichotomized into impaired ({$\geqq$}1 SD below controls) versus nonimpaired. MRI scans were evaluated with a global-brain volumetric measure [brain fractional ratio (BFR)] and with visually based medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) ratings. \emph{Results:} Amnestic CIND had neuropsychological impairment in the episodic memory domain and also in nonmemory domains. There were 80\% of CIND subjects with multidomain impairment. The most clear-cut nonmemory impairment was in the verbal ability domain, with 64\% of subjects affected and a moderate effect size (d = 0.7). On MRI, BFR was lower (74.5 {$\pm$} 4.6 vs. 75.5 {$\pm$} 4.4) and MTA higher (72 vs. 38\% with MTA {$\geqq$}1) in CIND than in control subjects. BFR correlated with MTA (r = \textendash 0.45) and with a composite memory score (r = 0.296). \emph{Conclusion:} A prospective amnestic CIND grouping appears to identify individuals with a multidomain pattern of neuropsychological impairment and with both medial temporal lobe and global brain atrophy.},

  abstract = {Objectives The objective of this review is to identify all preprint platforms with biomedical and medical scope and to compare and contrast the key characteristics and policies of these platforms. Study design and setting Preprint platforms that were launched up to 25 June 2019 and have a biomedical and medical scope according to MEDLINE's journal selection criteria were identified using existing lists, web-based searches and the expertise of both academic and non-academic publication scientists. A data extraction form was developed, pilot tested and used to collect data from each preprint platform's webpage(s). Results A total of 44 preprint platforms were identified as having biomedical and medical scope, 17 (39\%) were hosted by the Open Science Framework preprint infrastructure, 6 (14\%) were provided by F1000 Research (the Open Research Central infrastructure) and 21 (48\%) were other independent preprint platforms. Preprint platforms were either owned by non-profit academic groups, scientific societies or funding organisations (n=28; 64\%), owned/partly owned by for-profit publishers or companies (n=14; 32\%) or owned by individuals/small communities (n=2; 5\%). Twenty-four (55\%) preprint platforms accepted content from all scientific fields although some of these had restrictions relating to funding source, geographical region or an affiliated journal's remit. Thirty-three (75\%) preprint platforms provided details about article screening (basic checks) and 14 (32\%) of these actively involved researchers with context expertise in the screening process. Almost all preprint platforms allow submission to any peer-reviewed journal following publication, have a preservation plan for read access and most have a policy regarding reasons for retraction and the sustainability of the service. Conclusion A large number of preprint platforms exist for use in biomedical and medical sciences, all of which offer researchers an opportunity to rapidly disseminate their research findings onto an open-access public server, subject to scope and eligibility.},

In follow-up analyses using MR, there was only evidence that education, fluid intelligence score, hip circumference, forced vital capacity, and self-reported moderate physical activity were likely to be causal risk factors for Alzheimer9s disease. Conclusion and relevance Genetic liability for Alzheimer9s disease is associated with over 160 phenotypes, some as early as age 39 years.

  abstract = {Background. The standard approach for survival analysis of the elderly population is to define the survival time as the elapsed time from entry into the study until death, and to adjust by age using stratification and regression procedures. However, the interest is in the study of the aging process and the risk factors related to it, not in the use of timeon-study as the'time scale. Here, we present methods to use age as the time scale and compare inferences and interpretations with those obtained using the standard approach. Methods. A total of 1,315 individuals aged 65 years or older from the city of Barcelona, Spain, were interviewed in 1986 (baseline). The vital status of the cohort was assessed in October 1994. To illustrate the usefulness of age as time scale (alternative approach) instead of tjme-on-study in the survival analysis of the elderly population, both methods were used to assess the relationship between baseline functional capacity and mortality. Results. Using the alternative approach, we observed that 50\% of the sample died at age 80.6 years; this information could not be estimated with the standard approach. Using age as a covariate in the standard analysis with time-onstudy as the time scale and using age as the time scale in the alternative analysis, the association of functional capacity at baseline and mortality was of similar magnitude under both analyses. Nevertheless, using the alternative approach, relative risks were slightly lower, and the adjustment by age was tight and was not subject to the inherent assumptions in regression models of the functional relationship of independent variables with outcome. We illustrated the methods with fixed covariates (i.e., gender) and baseline values of time-dependent covariates (i.e., functional capacity), but we discussed the extension of our methods for the analysis of time-dependent covariates measured at several visits in a cohort study. Methods proposed here are easily implemented with widely available statistical software packages. Conclusions. Although the use of standard survival analysis generally produces correct estimates, the use of age as time scale is deemed more appropriate for survival analysis of the elderly: Inferences are easier to interpret and final models are simpler. We therefore recommend the use of age as time scale for survival analysis of the elderly population.},

  abstract = {Triangulation is the practice of obtaining more reliable answers to research questions through integrating results from several different approaches, where each approach has different key sources of potential bias that are unrelated to each other. With respect to causal questions in aetiological epidemiology, if the results of different approaches all point to the same conclusion, this strengthens confidence in the finding. This is particularly the case when the key sources of bias of some of the approaches would predict that findings would point in opposite directions if they were due to such biases. Where there are inconsistencies, understanding the key sources of bias of each approach can help to identify what further research is required to address the causal question. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how triangulation might be used to improve causal inference in aetiological epidemiology. We propose a minimum set of criteria for use in triangulation in aetiological epidemiology, summarize the key sources of bias of several approaches and describe how these might be integrated within a triangulation framework. We emphasize the importance of being explicit about the expected direction of bias within each approach, whenever this is possible, and seeking to identify approaches that would be expected to bias the true causal effect in different directions. We also note the importance, when comparing results, of taking account of differences in the duration and timing of exposures. We provide three examples to illustrate these points.},

  abstract = {Background The UK government introduced two financial incentive schemes for primary care to tackle underdiagnosis in dementia: the 3-year Directed Enhanced Service 18 (DES18) and the 6-month Dementia Identification Scheme (DIS). The schemes appear to have been effective in boosting dementia diagnosis rates, but their unintended effects are unknown. Aim To identify and quantify unintended consequences associated with the DES18 and DIS schemes. Design and setting A retrospective cohort quantitative study of 7079 English primary care practices. Method Potential unintended effects of financial incentive schemes, both positive and negative, were identified from a literature review. A practice-level dataset covering the period 2006/2007 to 2015/2016 was constructed. Difference-in-differences analysis was employed to test the effects of the incentive schemes on quality measures from the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF); and four measures of patient experience from the GP Patient Survey (GPPS): patient-centred care, access to care, continuity of care, and the doctor\textendash patient relationship. The researchers controlled for effects of the contemporaneous hospital incentive scheme for dementia and for practice characteristics. Results National practice participation rates in DES18 and DIS were 98.5\% and 76\% respectively. Both schemes were associated not only with a positive impact on QOF quality outcomes, but also with negative impacts on some patient experience indicators. Conclusion The primary care incentive schemes for dementia appear to have enhanced QOF performance for the dementia review, and have had beneficial spillover effects on QOF performance in other clinical areas. However, the schemes may have had negative impacts on several aspects of patient experience.},

  abstract = {Objectives Ovarian cancer is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage when five-year relative survival is {$<$}50\%. Therefore, strategies to improve survival are required. Studies suggest associations between common chronic disease medications such as metformin, statins, beta-blockers, aspirin and non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NA-NSAIDs) and improved cancer survival. We aimed to review the evidence for a possible relation between these medications and survival among women with ovarian cancer. Methods We conducted four systematic reviews and evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies. Where possible, we calculated pooled hazard ratios (pHR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI), excluding studies considered to have the potential for immortal time bias (ITB) which, in practice, was the major source of bias. Results We identified 36 studies evaluating one or more of the medications (metformin n~=~8, statins n~=~12, beta-blockers n~=~11, aspirin and/or NA-NSAIDs n~=~9). We rated 21 studies as ITB-free. The meta-analysis of the ITB-free studies suggested improved survival in statin users compared to non-users (pHR: 0.76, 95\%CI: 0.68\textendash 0.85), but no overall survival benefit associated with use of metformin, beta-blockers, aspirin or NA-NSAIDs. The pooled result of two studies did, however, suggest a possible association between perioperative beta-blocker use and improved survival. Studies considered to have potential ITB were more likely to report survival benefits associated with these medications. Conclusion Statin use is associated with better ovarian cancer survival but further study, preferably a clinical trial, is required. There are insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding metformin, beta-blockers, aspirin and NA-NSAIDs.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of adult-onset dementia is characterized by a progressive decline of cognitive functions accompanied by behavioral manifestations. The main class of drugs currently used for the treatment of AD are acetylcholinesterase/cholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-Is). The first ChE-I licensed for symptomatic treatment of AD was tacrine. The ChE-Is currently available in the market are donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine as tacrine is no longer in use, due to its hepatotoxicity. According to mechanism of action the ChE-Is are classified as short-acting or reversible agents such as tacrine, donepezil, and galantamine, as intermediate-acting or pseudo-irreversible agent such as rivastigmine. Overall, the efficacy of the three ChE-Is available in the market is similar and the benefit of administration of these compounds is mild and may not be clinically significant. Due to gastrointestinal side effects of these drugs, medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutical delivery studies have investigated solutions to improve the pharmacological activity of these compounds. In spite of the limited activity of ChE-Is, waiting for more effective approaches, these drugs still represent a pharmacotherapeutic resource for the treatment of AD. Other approaches in which ChE-Is were investigated is in their use in combination with other classes of drugs such as cholinergic precursors, N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists and antioxidant agents. After many years from the introduction in therapy of ChE-Is, the combination with other classes of drugs may represent the chance for a renewed interest of ChE-Is in the treatment of adult-onset dementia disorders.},

  abstract = {Population health researchers from different fields often address similar substantive questions but rely on different study designs, reflecting their home disciplines. This is especially true in studies involving causal inference, for which semantic and substantive differences inhibit interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration. In this paper, we group nonrandomized study designs into two categories: those that use confounder-control (such as regression adjustment or propensity score matching) and those that rely on an instrument (such as instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, or differences-in-differences approaches). Using the Shadish, Cook, and Campbell framework for evaluating threats to validity, we contrast the assumptions, strengths, and limitations of these two approaches and illustrate differences with examples from the literature on education and health. Across disciplines, all methods to test a hypothesized causal relationship involve unverifiable assumptions, and rarely is there clear justification for exclusive reliance on one method. Each method entails trade-offs between statistical power, internal validity, measurement quality, and generalizability. The choice between confounder-control and instrument-based methods should be guided by these tradeoffs and consideration of the most important limitations of previous work in the area. Our goals are to foster common understanding of the methods available for causal inference in population health research and the tradeoffs between them; to encourage researchers to objectively evaluate what can be learned from methods outside one's home discipline; and to facilitate the selection of methods that best answer the investigator's scientific questions.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of the study is to assess the validity of codes or algorithms used to identify dementia in UK electronic health record (EHR) primary care and hospitalisation databases. Methods Relevant studies were identified by searching the MEDLINE/EMBASE databases from inception to June 2018, hand-searching reference lists, and consulting experts. The search strategy included synonyms for ``Dementia'', ``Europe'', and ``EHR''. Studies were included if they validated dementia diagnoses in UK primary care or hospitalisation databases, irrespective of validation method used. The Quality Assessment for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess risk of bias. Results From 1469 unique records, 14 relevant studies were included. Thirteen validated individual diagnoses against a reference standard, reporting high estimates of validity. Most reported only the positive predictive value (PPV), with estimates ranging between 0.09 and 1.0 and 0.62 and 0.85 in primary care and hospitalisation databases, respectively. One study performed a rate comparison, indicating good generalisability of dementia diagnoses in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database to the UK population. Studies were of low methodological quality. As studies were not comparable, no summary validity estimates were produced. Conclusion While heterogenous across studies, reported validity estimates were generally high. However, the credibility of these estimates is limited by the methodological quality of studies, primarily resulting from insufficient blinding of researchers interpreting the reference test. Inadequate reporting, particularly of the specific codes validated, hindered comparison of estimates across studies. Future validation studies should make use of more robust reference tests, follow established reporting guidelines, and calculate all measures of validity.},

  abstract = {The kappa statistic is frequently used to test interrater reliability. The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

Unsystematic findings suggest an influence of comorbidities on the extent of differences in the length of hospital stay (LOS). This systematic review aimed to identify and evaluate all studies reporting LOS in PWD as compared to PwoD in general hospitals. Methods A systematic review of observational studies using PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge. Inclusion criteria comprised original studies written in English or German, assessment of diagnosis of dementia, measurement of LOS, and comparison of people with and without dementia. Results Fifty-two of 60 studies reported a longer hospitalization time for PWD compared to PwoD. The extent of the difference in LOS varied between and within countries as well as by type of primary morbidity (eg, injuries, cardiovascular diseases). The range of the LOS difference for studies without restriction to a primary morbidity was -2 to +22 days after matching or adjustment for a variable number and selection of potentially relevant covariates. For studies with injuries/fractures/medical procedures and infectious/vascular disease as the primary morbidity, the range was -2.9 to +12.4 and -11.2 to +21.8 days, respectively. Conclusions The majority of studies reported a longer hospitalization of PWD compared to PwoD. Length of hospital stay seems to be influenced by a variety of medical, social, organizational factors, including reasons for hospital admission, whose role should be explored in detail in further research.},

Design Systematic review of published IPD meta-analyses, supplemented by a reflection of the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's 20 years' experience of requesting IPD. Data sources Medline, CENTRAL, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, and PsycINFO. Eligibility criteria for study selection IPD meta-analyses of studies of all designs and all clinical areas published in English. Results 760 IPD meta-analyses which identified studies by systematic methods that had been published between 1987 and 2015 were included. Only 188 (25\%) of these IPD meta-analyses retrieved 100\% of the eligible IPD for analysis, with 324 (43\%) of these IPD meta-analyses retrieving 80\% or more of relevant IPD. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that IPD retrieval rates have improved over time. IPD meta-analyses that included only randomised trials, had an authorship policy, included fewer eligible participants, and were conducted outside of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were associated with a high or complete IPD retrieval rate. There was no association between the source of funding of the IPD meta-analyses and IPD retrieval rate. The IPD retrieval rate of the Cochrane Epilepsy Group has declined from 83\% (up to 2005) to 65\% (between 2012 and 2015) and the reported reasons for lack of data availability have changed in recent years. Conclusions IPD meta-analyses are considered to be the ``gold standard'' for the synthesis of data from clinical research studies; however, only 25\% of published IPD meta-analyses have had access to all IPD.},

Triangulation is also an effort to help explore and explain complex human behaviour using a variety of methods to offer a more balanced explanation to readers.2 It is a procedure that enables validation of data and can be used in both quantitative and qualitative studies. Triangulation can enrich research as it offers a variety of datasets to explain differing aspects of a phenomenon of interest. It also helps refute where one dataset invalidates a supposition generated by another. It can assist the confirming of a hypothesis where one set of findings confirms another set. Finally, triangulation can help explain the results of a study.3 Central to triangulation is the notion that methods leading to the same results give more confidence in the research findings.4  Four types of triangulation are proposed by Denzin (p.301):5 (1)~data triangulation, which~includes matters \ldots},

Aim:               This scoping review will focus on answering key questions about the state of the evidence on the behavioural determinants of adherence to social distancing measures in research on COVID-19.~                                         Methods:               A scoping review will be conducted in accordance with guidelines for best practice. Literature searches will be conducted using online databases and grey literature sources. Databases will include Medline, Web of Science, Embase and PsycInfo, alongside relevant pre-print servers. Grey literature will be searched on Google Scholar. Screening, data extraction and quality appraisal will be conducted by members of the research team, with any discrepancies resolved by consensus discussion. Quality appraisal will be conducted using the Cochrane's ROBINS-I tool, the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist where appropriate.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Synthesis of multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in a systematic review can summarize the effects of individual outcomes and provide numerical answers about the effectiveness of interventions. Filtering of searches is time consuming, and no single method fulfills the principal requirements of speed with accuracy. Automation of systematic reviews is driven by a necessity to expedite the availability of current best evidence for policy and clinical decision-making. We developed Rayyan ( http://rayyan.qcri.org ), a free web and mobile app, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability. For the beta testing phase, we used two published Cochrane reviews in which included studies had been selected manually. Their searches, with 1030 records and 273 records, were uploaded to Rayyan. Different features of Rayyan were tested using these two reviews. We also conducted a survey of Rayyan's users and collected feedback through a built-in feature. RESULTS: Pilot testing of Rayyan focused on usability, accuracy against manual methods, and the added value of the prediction feature. The "taster" review (273 records) allowed a quick overview of Rayyan for early comments on usability. The second review (1030 records) required several iterations to identify the previously identified 11 trials. The "suggestions" and "hints," based on the "prediction model," appeared as testing progressed beyond five included studies. Post rollout user experiences and a reflexive response by the developers enabled real-time modifications and improvements. The survey respondents reported 40\% average time savings when using Rayyan compared to others tools, with 34\% of the respondents reporting more than 50\% time savings. In addition, around 75\% of the respondents mentioned that screening and labeling studies as well as collaborating on reviews to be the two most important features of Rayyan. As of November 2016, Rayyan users exceed 2000 from over 60 countries conducting hundreds of reviews totaling more than 1.6M citations. Feedback from users, obtained mostly through the app web site and a recent survey, has highlighted the ease in exploration of searches, the time saved, and simplicity in sharing and comparing include-exclude decisions. The strongest features of the app, identified and reported in user feedback, were its ability to help in screening and collaboration as well as the time savings it affords to users. CONCLUSIONS: Rayyan is responsive and intuitive in use with significant potential to lighten the load of reviewers.},

METHODS: We studied the prevalence of treatment in subjects with dementia among European countries in 2004 (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom) by using estimates of prevalence of dementia and of ChI treatments according to sales and reimbursement data. RESULTS: In 2004, estimated prevalence of ChI use among subjects with dementia ranged from 3.0\% in the Netherlands to 20.3\% in France. It was 17.5\% in Spain, 6.7\% in the UK and 5.9\% in Italy. Donepezil was used by more than 60\% of patients using a single ChI and represented almost 50\% of reimbursements for patients that had used at least two different ChIs during the year. Galantamine and rivastigmine were respectively used by 22 and 18\% of subjects using a single drug and 27 and 23\% of reimbursements for patients that had used at least two different ChIs. Nevertheless, different patterns of use were found for individual countries. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of treatment by ChIs among subjects with dementia remains weak and varies greatly across Europe. Differences in reimbursement rates and health policies could partly explain these variations, as ChIs could have failed to convince health authorities because the outcomes considered for trials are not used by clinicians in their everyday practice. If donepezil was highly predominant across countries, variations in rivastigmine and galantamine importance could reflect local market specificities.},

The aim of this study is to provide an overview and guidance on some of the available methodologies used to address problems related to time-varying exposure and confounding in pharmacoepidemiology and other observational studies. The methods are explored from a conceptual rather than an analytical perspective. Methods: The methods described in this study have been identified exploring the literature concerning to the time-varying exposure concept and basing the search on four fundamental pharmacoepidemiological problems, construction of treatment episodes, time-varying confounders, cumulative exposure and latency, and treatment switching. Results: A correct treatment episodes construction is fundamental to avoid bias in treatment effect estimates. Several methods exist to address time-varying covariates, but the complexity of the most advanced approaches\textemdash eg, marginal structural models or structural nested failure time models\textemdash and the lack of user-friendly statistical packages have prevented broader adoption of these methods. Consequently, simpler methods are most commonly used, including, for example, methods without any adjustment strategy and models with time-varying covariates. The magnitude of exposure needs to be considered and properly modelled. Conclusions: Further research on the application and implementation of the most complex methods is needed. Because different methods can lead to substantial differences in the treatment effect estimates, the application of several methods and comparison of the results is recommended. Treatment episodes estimation and exposure quantification are key parts in the estimation of treatment effects or associations of interest.},

These subjects are becoming the focus of many prediction studies and early intervention trials. OBJECTIVE: To characterize clinically subjects with MCI cross-sectionally and longitudinally. DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal inception cohort. SETTING: General community clinic. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 76 consecutively evaluated subjects with MCI were compared with 234 healthy control subjects and 106 patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD), all from a community setting as part of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Center/Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry, Rochester, Minn. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 3 groups of individuals were compared on demographic factors and measures of cognitive function including the Mini-Mental State Examination, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, Dementia Rating Scale, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, and Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Clinical classifications of dementia and AD were determined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria, respectively. RESULTS: The primary distinction between control subjects and subjects with MCI was in the area of memory, while other cognitive functions were comparable. However, when the subjects with MCI were compared with the patients with very mild AD, memory performance was similar, but patients with AD were more impaired in other cognitive domains as well. Longitudinal performance demonstrated that the subjects with MCI declined at a rate greater than that of the controls but less rapidly than the patients with mild AD. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who meet the criteria for MCI can be differentiated from healthy control subjects and those with very mild AD. They appear to constitute a clinical entity that can be characterized for treatment interventions.},

However, the exact values of such statistics are commonly hidden in figures.                                               Extracting descriptive statistics from figures can be a slow process that is not easily reproducible. Additionally, current software lacks an ability to incorporate important meta-data (e.g., sample sizes, treatment / variable names) about experiments and is not integrated with other software to streamline analysis pipelines.                                                                  Here we present the R package                   metaDigitise                   which extracts descriptive statistics such as means, standard deviations and correlations from four plot types: 1) mean/error plots (e.g. bar graphs with standard errors), 2) box plots, 3) scatter plots and 4) histograms.                   metaDigitise                   is user-friendly and easy to learn as it interactively guides the user through the data extraction process. Notably, it enables large-scale extraction by automatically loading image files, letting the user stop processing, edit and add to the resulting data-frame at any point.                                                                Digitised data can be easily re-plotted and checked, facilitating reproducible data extraction from plots with little inter-observer bias. We hope that by making the process of figure extraction more flexible and easy to conduct it will improve the transparency and quality of meta-analyses in the future.},

  abstract = {Background Current projections of the scale of the coming dementia epidemic assume that the age- and sex-specific prevalence of dementia will not vary over time, and that population ageing alone (increasing the number of older people at risk) drives the projected increases. The basis for this assumption is doubtful, and secular trends (that is, gradual decreases or increases in prevalence over long-term periods) are perfectly plausible. Methods We carried out a systematic review of studies of trends in prevalence, incidence and mortality for people with dementia, conducted since 1980. Results We identified nine studies that had tracked dementia prevalence, eight that had tracked dementia incidence, and four that had tracked mortality among people with dementia. There was some moderately consistent evidence to suggest that the incidence of dementia may be declining in high-income countries. Evidence on trends in the prevalence of dementia were inconsistent across studies and did not suggest any clear overall effect. Declining incidence may be balanced by longer survival with dementia, although mortality trends have been little studied. There is some evidence to suggest increasing prevalence in East Asia, consistent with worsening cardiovascular risk factor profiles, although secular changes in diagnostic criteria may also have contributed. Conclusions We found no evidence to suggest that the current assumption of constant age-specific prevalence of dementia over time is ill-founded. However, there remains some uncertainty as to the future scale of the dementia epidemic. Population ageing seems destined to play the greatest role, and prudent policymakers should plan future service provision based upon current prevalence projections. Additional priorities should include investing in brain health promotion and dementia prevention programs, and monitoring the future course of the epidemic to chart the effectiveness of these measures.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) is an ongoing multi-centre prospective cohort study designed to investigate the relationship between nutrition and cancer, with the potential for studying other diseases as well. The study currently includes 519 978 participants (366 521 women and 153 457 men, mostly aged 35\textendash 70 years) in 23 centres located in 10 European countries, to be followed for cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality for several decades. At enrolment, which took place between 1992 and 2000 at each of the different centres, information was collected through a non-dietary questionnaire on lifestyle variables and through a dietary questionnaire addressing usual diet. Anthropometric measurements were performed and blood samples taken, from which plasma, serum, red cells and buffy coat fractions were separated and aliquoted for long-term storage, mostly in liquid nitrogen. To calibrate dietary measurements, a standardised, computer-assisted 24-hour dietary recall was implemented at each centre on stratified random samples of the participants, for a total of 36 900 subjects. EPIC represents the largest single resource available today world-wide for prospective investigations on the aetiology of cancers (and other diseases) that can integrate questionnaire data on lifestyle and diet, biomarkers of diet and of endogenous metabolism (e.g. hormones and growth factors) and genetic polymorphisms. First results of case\textendash control studies nested within the cohort are expected early in 2003. The present paper provides a description of the EPIC study, with the aim of simplifying reference to it in future papers reporting substantive or methodological studies carried out in the EPIC cohort.},

  abstract = {Precision medicine research often searches for treatment-covariate interactions, which refers to when a treatment effect (eg, measured as a mean difference, odds ratio, hazard ratio) changes across values of a participant-level covariate (eg, age, gender, biomarker). Single trials do not usually have sufficient power to detect genuine treatment-covariate interactions, which motivate the sharing of individual participant data (IPD) from multiple trials for meta-analysis. Here, we provide statistical recommendations for conducting and planning an IPD meta-analysis of randomized trials to examine treatment-covariate interactions. For conduct, two-stage and one-stage statistical models are described, and we recommend: (i) interactions should be estimated directly, and not by calculating differences in meta-analysis results for subgroups; (ii) interaction estimates should be based solely on within-study information; (iii) continuous covariates and outcomes should be analyzed on their continuous scale; (iv) nonlinear relationships should be examined for continuous covariates, using a multivariate meta-analysis of the trend (eg, using restricted cubic spline functions); and (v) translation of interactions into clinical practice is nontrivial, requiring individualized treatment effect prediction. For planning, we describe first why the decision to initiate an IPD meta-analysis project should not be based on between-study heterogeneity in the overall treatment effect; and second, how to calculate the power of a potential IPD meta-analysis project in advance of IPD collection, conditional on characteristics (eg, number of participants, standard deviation of covariates) of the trials (potentially) promising their IPD. Real IPD meta-analysis projects are used for illustration throughout.},

We offer critical review of contemporary dementia research and discuss potential reasons why progress in the field has not been as rapid as in other disciplines. We adopt a broad approach in keeping with the broad nature of the topic. We cover the difficulties inherent in studying dementia from 'bench' to 'bedside' to 'population'. We make particular reference to issues of operationalisation of the dementia syndrome and our evolving understanding of dementia as a research 'outcome'. We discuss contemporary 'hot topics' in dementia research methodology focussing on dementia models, pre-dementia states and biomarkers. Recognising the importance of prospective epidemiological cohorts and large-scale clinical trials we pay particular attention to these approaches and the challenges of generating results that have 'real world' external validity. Based on our thoughts we end with suggestions for future dementia research. Our review is designed to be critical but not unnecessarily negative. There is reason for cautious optimism in dementia research. The recent G8 summit on dementia and subsequent establishment of the World Dementia Council are examples of initiatives that reflect societal and political will to increase research efforts in dementia.},

  abstract = {Objective Improving dementia care is a policy priority nationally and internationally; there is a `diagnosis gap' with less than half of the cases of dementia ever diagnosed. The English Health Department's Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) encourages primary care recognition and recording of dementia. The codes for dementia are complex with the possibility of underidentification through miscoding. We developed guidance on coding of dementia; we report the impact of applying this to `clean up' dementia coding and records at a practice level. Design The guidance had five elements: (1) identify Read Codes for dementia; (2) access QOF dementia register; (3) generate lists of patients who may have dementia; (4) compare search with QOF data and (5) review cases. In each practice, one general practitioner conducted the exercise. The number of dementia QOF registers before and after the exercise was recorded with the hours taken to complete the exercise. Setting London primary care. Participants 23 (85\%) of 27 practices participated, covering 79 312 (19 562 over 65 s) participants. Outcomes The number on dementia QOF registers; time taken. Results The number of people with dementia on QOF registers increased from 1007 to 1139 ({$\chi$}2=8.17, p=0.004), raising identification rates by 8.8\%. It took 4.7 h per practice, on an average. Conclusions These data demonstrate the potential of a simple primary care coding exercise, requiring no specific training, to increase the dementia identification rate. An improvement of 8.8\% between 2011 and 2012 is equivalent to that of the fourth most improved primary care trust in the UK. In absolute terms, if this effects were mirrored across the UK primary care, the number of cases with dementia identified would rise by over 70 000 from 364 329 to 434 488 raising the recognition rate from 46\% to 54.8\%. Implementing this exercise appears to be a simple and effective way to improve recognition rates in primary care.},

Conventional methods for the analysis of survival data assume independent or noninformative censoring, which is violated when subjects that experience a competing event are censored. Because many survival studies do not apply competing risk analysis, we explain and illustrate in a nonmathematical way how to analyze and interpret survival data in the presence of competing events. Study Design and Setting Using data from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, both marginal analyses (Kaplan\textendash Meier method and Cox proportional-hazards regression) and competing risk analyses (cumulative incidence function [CIF], cause-specific and subdistribution hazard regression) were performed. We analyzed the association between sex and depressive symptoms, in which death before the onset of depression was a competing event. Results The Kaplan\textendash Meier method overestimated the cumulative incidence of depressive symptoms. Instead, the CIF should be used. As the subdistribution hazard model has a one-to-one relation with the CIF, it is recommended for prediction research, whereas the cause-specific hazard model is recommended for etiologic research. Conclusion When competing risks are present, the type of research question guides the choice of the analytical model to be used. In any case, results should be presented for all event types.},

Preprint servers decouple dissemination of research papers from their evaluation and certification by journals, allowing researchers to share work immediately, receive feedback from a much larger audience, and provide evidence of productivity long before formal publication. Launched in 2013 as a non-profit community service, the bioRxiv server has brought preprint practice to the life sciences and recently posted its 64,000th manuscript. The server now receives more than four million views per month and hosts papers spanning all areas of biology. Initially dominated by evolutionary biology, genetics/genomics and computational biology, bioRxiv has been increasingly populated by papers in neuroscience, cell and developmental biology, and many other fields. Changes in journal and funder policies that encourage preprint posting have helped drive adoption, as has the development of bioRxiv technologies that allow authors to transfer papers easily between the server and journals. A bioRxiv user survey found that 42\% of authors post their preprints prior to journal submission whereas 37\% post concurrently with journal submission. Authors are motivated by a desire to share work early; they value the feedback they receive, and very rarely experience any negative consequences of preprint posting. Rapid dissemination via bioRxiv is also encouraging new initiatives that experiment with the peer review process and the development of novel approaches to literature filtering and assessment.},

These dependability models depend on precise specifications, but it is often impractical to obtain precise specifications of practical software-intensive systems. Furthermore, the criteria for acceptable behavior vary from time to time and from one user to another. When development methods are based on the classic models that assume precise specifications, the resulting systems are often brittle --- they are vulnerable to unexpected conditions and hard to tune to changing expectations. Practical systems would be better served by development models that recognize the variability and unpredictability of the environment in which the systems are used. Such development methods should pursue not the absolute criterion of correctness, but rather the goal of fitness for the intended task, or sufficient correctness. They should accommodate environmental unpredictability not only by reactive mechanisms, but also by design that produces resilience to environmental change, or homeostasis. In many cases, this resilience may be achievable by relaxing tolerances in the specifications, thereby enlarging the envelope of acceptable operation.},

Our aim was to test the benefits of pravastatin treatment in an elderly cohort of men and women with, or at high risk of developing, cardiovascular disease and stroke. METHODS: We did a randomised controlled trial in which we assigned 5804 men (n=2804) and women (n=3000) aged 70-82 years with a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease to pravastatin (40 mg per day; n=2891) or placebo (n=2913). Baseline cholesterol concentrations ranged from 4.0 mmol/L to 9.0 mmol/L. Follow-up was 3.2 years on average and our primary endpoint was a composite of coronary death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and fatal or non-fatal stroke. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: Pravastatin lowered LDL cholesterol concentrations by 34\% and reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint to 408 events compared with 473 on placebo (hazard ratio 0.85, 95\% CI 0.74-0.97, p=0.014). Coronary heart disease death and non-fatal myocardial infarction risk was also reduced (0.81, 0.69-0.94, p=0.006). Stroke risk was unaffected (1.03, 0.81-1.31, p=0.8), but the hazard ratio for transient ischaemic attack was 0.75 (0.55-1.00, p=0.051). New cancer diagnoses were more frequent on pravastatin than on placebo (1.25, 1.04-1.51, p=0.020). However, incorporation of this finding in a meta-analysis of all pravastatin and all statin trials showed no overall increase in risk. Mortality from coronary disease fell by 24\% (p=0.043) in the pravastatin group. Pravastatin had no significant effect on cognitive function or disability. INTERPRETATION: Pravastatin given for 3 years reduced the risk of coronary disease in elderly individuals. PROSPER therefore extends to elderly individuals the treatment strategy currently used in middle aged people.},

  abstract = {Aim To assess the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk stage II colorectal cancer. Method A systematic literature review and meta-analysis was performed comparing survival in patients with resected stage II colorectal cancer and high-risk features having postoperative chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy. Results Of 1031 articles screened, 29 were included, reporting on 183,749 participants. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR]=0.61, P{$<$}0.0001), disease-specific survival (HR=0.73, P=0.05), and disease-free survival (HR=0.59, P{$<$}0.0001) compared to no chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased 5-year overall survival (odds ratio [OR]=0.53, P=0.0008) and 5-year disease-free survival (OR=0.50, P=0.001). Overall survival and disease-free survival remained significantly prolonged during subgroup analysis of studies published from 2015 onwards (HR=0.60, P{$<$}0.0001; HR=0.65, P=0.0001; respectively), in patients with two or more high-risk features (HR=0.59, P=0.0001; HR=0.70, P=0.03; respectively), and in colon cancer (HR=0.61, P{$<$}0.0001; HR=0.51, P=0.0001; respectively). Overall survival, disease-specific survival, and disease-free survival during subgroup analysis of individual high-risk features, were: T4 tumour (HR=0.58, P{$<$}0.0001; HR 0.50, P=0.003; HR 0.75, P=0.05), {$<$}12 lymph nodes harvested (HR=0.67, P=0.0002; HR=0.80, P=0.17; HR=0.72, P=0.02), poor differentiation (HR=0.84, P=0.35; HR=0.85, P=0.23; HR=0.61, P=0.41), lymphovascular or perineural invasion (HR=0.55, P=0.05; HR=0.59, P=0.11; HR=0.76, P=0.05), emergency surgery (HR=0.60, P=0.02; HR=0.68, P=0.19). Conclusion Adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk stage II colorectal cancer results in a modest survival improvement and should be considered on an individual patient basis. Due to potential heterogeneity and selection bias of the included studies, and lack of separate rectal cancer data, further large randomized trials with predefined inclusion criteria and standardized chemotherapy regimens are required.},

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS \textbullet{} This study was larger and more statistically powerful than the combined total of data from all randomized trials of statins undertaken to date. \textbullet{} The validity of the study is supported by findings for vascular outcomes being comparable to those observed in large randomized controlled trials. \textbullet{} There was little evidence to support effects of statins beyond their established effects on cardiovascular disease. AIMS To assess the effect of statins on a range of health outcomes. METHODS We undertook a population-based cohort study to assess the effect of statins on a range of health outcomes using a propensity score-based method to control for differences between people prescribed and not prescribed statins. We validated our design by comparing our results for vascular outcomes with the effects established in large randomized trials. The study was based on the United Kingdom Health Improvement Network database that includes the computerized medical records of over four and a half million patients. RESULTS People who initiated treatment with a statin (n = 129 288) were compared with a matched sample of 600 241 people who did not initiate treatment, with a median follow-up period of 4.4 years. Statin use was not associated with an effect on a wide range of outcomes, including infections, fractures, venous thromboembolism, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, or on specific eye, neurological or autoimmune diseases. A protective effect against dementia was observed (hazard ratio 0.80, 99\% confidence interval 0.68, 0.95). There was no effect on the risk of cancer even after {$\geq$}8 years of follow-up. The effect sizes for statins on vascular end-points and mortality were comparable to those observed in large randomized trials, suggesting bias and confounding had been well controlled for. CONCLUSIONS We found little evidence to support wide-ranging effects of statins on health outcomes beyond their established beneficial effect on vascular disease.},

For a scientist to be successful, he or she needs to be able to claim credit or priority for discoveries throughout their career. However, despite being fundamental to the reward system of science, the principles for establishing the "priority of discovery" are rarely discussed. Here we break down priority into two steps: disclosure, in which the discovery is released to the world-wide community; and validation, in which other scientists assess the accuracy, quality and importance of the work. Currently, in biology, disclosure and an initial validation are combined in a journal publication. Here, we discuss the advantages of separating these steps into disclosure via a preprint, and validation via a combination of peer review at a journal and additional evaluation by the wider scientific community.},

Poor reporting hampers the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of a study and the generalisability of its results. Taking into account empirical evidence and theoretical considerations, a group of methodologists, researchers, and editors developed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommendations to improve the quality of reporting of observational studies. The STROBE Statement consists of a checklist of 22 items, which relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to cohort studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional studies and four are specific to each of the three study designs. The STROBE Statement provides guidance to authors about how to improve the reporting of observational studies and facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of studies by reviewers, journal editors and readers. This explanatory and elaboration document is intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the STROBE Statement. The meaning and rationale for each checklist item are presented. For each item, one or several published examples and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature are provided. Examples of useful flow diagrams are also included. The STROBE Statement, this document, and the associated Web site (http://www.strobe-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of observational research.},

The kappa statistic (or kappa coefficient) is the most commonly used statistic for this purpose. A kappa of 1 indicates perfect agreement, whereas a kappa of 0 indicates agreement equivalent to chance. A limitation of kappa is that it is affected by the prevalence of the finding under observation. Methods to overcome this limitation have been described.},

  abstract = {Much of biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalizability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case\textendash control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case\textendash control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed Explanation and Elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the web sites of PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine, and Epidemiology. We hope that the STROBE Statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.},

We will investigate the potential of a selection of commonly prescribed drugs, as a more efficient and cost-effective method of identifying new drugs for the prevention or treatment of Alzheimers disease, non-Alzheimers disease dementias, Parkinsons disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our research will focus on drugs used for the treatment of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and type 2 diabetes, all of which have previously been identified as potentially cerebroprotective and have variable levels of preclinical evidence that suggest they may have beneficial effects for various aspects of dementia pathology.Methods and analysis We will conduct a hypothesis testing observational cohort study using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Our analysis will consider four statistical methods, which have different approaches for modelling confounding. These are multivariable adjusted Cox regression; propensity matched regression; instrumental variable analysis and marginal structural models. We will also use an intention-to-treat analysis, whereby we will define all exposures based on the first prescription observed in the database so that the target parameter is comparable to that estimated by a randomised controlled trial.Ethics and dissemination This protocol has been approved by the CPRDs Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC). We will publish the results of the study as open-access peer-reviewed publications and disseminate findings through national and international conferences as are appropriate.},

In addition, some treatments for hypertension have been proposed to have cognitive benefits, independent of their effect on hypertension. Consequently, there is potential to repurpose treatments for hypertension for dementia. This study systematically compared seven antihypertensive drug classes for this purpose, using data on over 849,000 patients from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Treatments for hypertension were assessed in an instrumental variable (IV) analysis to address potential confounding and reverse causation. Physicians' prescribing preference was used as a categorical instrument, defined by the physicians' last seven prescriptions. Participants were new antihypertensive users between 1996-2016, aged 40 and over.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Findings{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We analysed 849,378 patients with total follow up of 5,497,266 patient-years. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers and vasodilator antihypertensives were found to confer small protective effects \textendash{} for example, vasodilator antihypertensives resulted in 27 (95\% CI: 17 to 38; p=4.4e-7) fewer cases of any dementia per 1000 treated compared with diuretics.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We found small differences in antihypertensive drug class effects on risk of dementia outcomes. However, we show the magnitude of the differences between drug classes is smaller than previously reported. Future research should look to implement other causal analysis methods to address biases in conventional observational research with the ultimate aim of triangulating the evidence concerning this hypothesis.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Funding{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}This work was supported by the Perros Trust and the Integrative Epidemiology Unit.

Seven comparable observational studies were identified that used either case-control designs with logistic regression or cohort designs with survival analysis.

However, conventional observational analyses, such as these, can be subject to confounding and reverse causation.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Added value of this study{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We have provided new evidence about the potential effects of antihypertensives on risk of dementia through the novel application of instrumental variable analysis to this research question and have shown that the magnitude of the differences between drug classes is smaller than many observational studies have previously reported.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Implications of all the available evidence{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Further research is needed to triangulate this evidence with other sources and to understand the inconsistencies between the studies conducted to date.

Variants were weighted by associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) using data from lipid genetics consortia (N up to 295 826). We meta-analysed MR estimates for regional variants weighted by LDL-C on AD risk from two large samples (total N = 24718 cases, 56685 controls). Results Models for HMGCR, APOB and NPC1L1 did not suggest that the use of related lipid-lowering drug classes would affect AD risk. In contrast, exposure to PCSK9 inhibitors was predicted to increase AD risk in both of the AD samples (combined odds ratio per standard deviation lower LDL-C inducible by the drug target = 1.45; 95\% confidence interval: 1.23, 1.69). This risk increase was opposite to, though more modest than, the degree of protection from coronary artery disease predicted by these same methods for PCSK9 inhibition.

  abstract = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

  abstract = {Objectives This study measures the average per person and annual total costs of dementia in England in 2015. Methods/Design Up-to-date data for England were drawn from multiple sources to identify prevalence of dementia by severity, patterns of health and social care service utilisation and their unit costs, levels of unpaid care and its economic impacts, and other costs of dementia. These data were used in a refined macrosimulation model to estimate annual per-person and aggregate costs of dementia. Results There are around 690~000 people with dementia in England, of whom 565~000 receive unpaid care or community care or live in a care home. Total annual cost of dementia in England is estimated to be \textsterling 24.2 billion in 2015, of which 42\% (\textsterling 10.1 billion) is attributable to unpaid care. Social care costs (\textsterling 10.2 billion) are three times larger than health care costs (\textsterling 3.8 billion). \textsterling 6.2 billion of the total social care costs are met by users themselves and their families, with \textsterling 4.0 billion (39.4\%) funded by government. Total annual costs of mild, moderate, and severe dementia are \textsterling 3.2 billion, \textsterling 6.9 billion, and \textsterling 14.1 billion, respectively. Average costs of mild, moderate, and severe dementia are \textsterling 24~400, \textsterling 27~450, and \textsterling 46~050, respectively, per person per year. Conclusions Dementia has huge economic impacts on people living with the illness, their carers, and society as a whole. Better support for people with dementia and their carers, as well as fair and efficient financing of social care services, are essential to address the current and future challenges of dementia.},

  abstract = {Background Trial and observational evidence is conflicting in terms of the association of blood lipids, atherosclerosis and statin use with dementia and cognitive impairment in the general population. It is uncertain whether the associations occur in stroke patients, who are at known higher risk of cognitive decline. This systematic review was to synthesize the evidence for these associations among stroke patients. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and trial registries were searched. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational cohort studies conducted among patients with stroke and reported on the association of blood lipids, atherosclerosis or statin use with dementia or cognitive impairment. Meta-analysis was conducted separately for crude and maximally adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs). Results Of 18,026 records retrieved, 56 studies (one RCT and 55 cohort studies) comprising 38,423 stroke patients were included. For coronary heart disease, the pooled OR of dementia and cognitive impairment was 1.32 (95\%CI 1.10\textendash 1.58, n = 15 studies, I2 = 0\%) and 1.23 (95\%CI 0.99\textendash 1.54, n = 14, I2 = 26.9\%), respectively. Peripheral artery disease was associated with dementia (OR 3.59, 95\%CI 1.47\textendash 8.76, n = 2, I2 = 0\%) and cognitive impairment (OR 2.70, 95\%CI 1.09\textendash 6.69, n = 1). For carotid stenosis, the pooled OR of dementia and cognitive impairment was 2.67 (95\%CI 0.83\textendash 8.62, n = 3, I2 = 77.9\%) and 3.34 (95\%CI 0.79\textendash 14.1, n = 4, I2 = 96.6\%), respectively. For post-stroke statin use, the pooled OR of dementia and cognitive impairment was 0.89 (95\%CI 0.65\textendash 1.21, n = 1) and 0.56 (95\%CI 0.46-0.69, n = 3, I2 = 0\%), respectively. No association was observed for hypercholesterolemia. These results were mostly consistent with adjusted ORs or HRs, which were reported from limited evidence. Conclusion Atherosclerosis was associated with an increased risk of post-stroke dementia. Post-stroke statin use was associated with decreased risk of cognitive impairment. To confirm whether or not statins confer advantages in the post-stroke population in terms of preventing cognitive decline over and above their known effectiveness in reducing risk of further vascular events, further stroke trials including cognitive assessment and observational analyses adjusted for key confounders, focusing on key subgroups or statin use patterns are required.},

  abstract = {Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text, Previous studies have indicated that statins use is associated with risk of dementia, but presented controversial results. Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database were searched update to November 2017 to identify the potential relationship between statins use and dementia. Thirty-one eligible studies involving a total of 3332,706 participants with 184,666 incident cases were included in this meta-analysis. Statins use was associated with dementia risk decrement (relevant risk [RR]: 0.85; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.80\textendash 0.89). Subgroup analysis showed statins use was associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) (RR: 0.81; 95\% CI, 0.73\textendash 0.89) and non-AD dementia (RR: 0.81; 95\% CI, 0.73\textendash 0.89) risk decrement. Furthermore, statins use was associated with dementia risk decrement in female (RR: 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.80\textendash 0.98) and male (RR: 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.83\textendash 0.93). In addition, a dose\textendash response showed per 1 year of duration of statins use incremental increase was associated with 20\% dementia risk decrement (RR: 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.73\textendash 0.87), and per 5-mg mean daily dose incremental increase in statins use was associated with 11\% dementia risk decrement (RR: 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.83\textendash 0.96). Statins use was associated with dementia risk decrement. The potency and the cumulative duration of statin utilized played critical roles.},

  abstract = {Instrumental variable analysis is a widely used method to estimate causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. When the instruments, exposure and outcome are not measured in the same sample, Angrist and Krueger (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc.87 (1992) 328\textendash 336) suggested to use two-sample instrumental variable (TSIV) estimators that use sample moments from an instrument-exposure sample and an instrument-outcome sample. However, this method is biased if the two samples are from heterogeneous populations so that the distributions of the instruments are different. In linear structural equation models, we derive a new class of TSIV estimators that are robust to heterogeneous samples under the key assumption that the structural relations in the two samples are the same. The widely used two-sample two-stage least squares estimator belongs to this class. It is generally not asymptotically efficient, although we find that it performs similarly to the optimal TSIV estimator in most practical situations. We then attempt to relax the linearity assumption. We find that, unlike one-sample analyses, the TSIV estimator is not robust to misspecified exposure model. Additionally, to nonparametrically identify the magnitude of the causal effect, the noise in the exposure must have the same distributions in the two samples. However, this assumption is in general untestable because the exposure is not observed in one sample. Nonetheless, we may still identify the sign of the causal effect in the absence of homogeneity of the noise.},
