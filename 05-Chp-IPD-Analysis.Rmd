## Methods

### Applying for data access

__Systematic review__

As part

As part of the IPD analysis, relevant cohort studies identified through the systematic review detailed in Chapters \@ref(sys-rev-heading) were. In the first instance, the corresponding author on the main man

__Dementia platform UK__

In addition, to assess the results for  the Dementia Platform UK common-access procedure was utilised. In short, this approach is intended to make it easier to access data from exisiting dementia cohorts through a centralised application process.

### Eligibility criteria

Lipids reported/available as a continuous measure, and were not cross-sectional.

Due to the limited time-frame, studies making use of population-level electronic health records, which often require an entire project proposal, were ineligible due to the time and cost involved in applying. The one exception to this was data from the CPRD, which we already had access to via the study reported in Chapter \'ref(cprd-heading).

Risk of bias assessment was performed for each of the included cohorts using the relevant tool described in Section \@ref(risk-of-bias).

There is some concerns about performing risk of bias assessments on your own analysis, and so

A two-stage model was used out of necessity, with the one-stage model being precluded by the different datasets being in protected data silos. 

A discrete proportional hazards model was employed to account for the interval censoring introduced by design o fthe longitudinal cohort studies.[@wang2017]

In order to investigate the interaction of patient-level characteristics with lipid levels, interaction terms for lipid-covariate terms were included in the model above. These were extracted and synthesised using a random effects meta-analysis.

Where results were comparably to previously published estimates, these were compared and reasons for any discrepancies discussed. 


The analysis were carried out in R (Version...) using the following packages: `survival`[@survival-book], `metafor`[@viechtbauer2010a]

__Replicating published findings__

Where any included data source had previously been analysed and results for the association between lipid levels and dementia reported, these were compared to the results of this analysis.

## Results

### Data access

<!-- Need exact number from each approach, plus detailed exclusion reasons -->

Of the XXX studies to which I applied for data access, only three were eventually included in the analysis. Figure \@ref(fig:cohortFlowchart) details whether the cohorts eventually included in the review were identified by the systematic review or via DPUK portal. 

In addition, the reasons for cohorts not being included in the analysis are presented. In summary, the requests for data from cohorts identified by the systematic review was characterised by a very low response rate. For the minority who did respond, common reasons given by corresponding authors for not sharing the data included that they no longer worked in the lab, had access to the data, or that they were currently or intended to perform a similar analysis as the one proposed.

For the streamlined DPUK process, where a dedicated project manager liases with cohort owners, the overall response rate was higher, result in access to three cohorts. However, even using th

Few cohorts were included in both the DPUK and the systematic review sets of cohorts indicating that the DPUK.

I did not request data from several DPUK cohorts due to the information on the online system indicating that the study was relatively new (and so was yet to collect >1 wave of data, as in the case of the XXXX cohort) or the online data dictionary indicating that the exposure variables of interest were not recorded.

As highlighted in the 

### Included data sources

The three datasets included are described in detail in the following section, and are summarised in Table \@ref(tab:cohortOverview-table).

Of note, all data sources included in the analysis were based in the United Kingdom. This is likely due to the majority of included datasets coming from the Dementia Platform UK route \@ref(fig:cohortFlowchart), which as implied by the name, has a geographical focus on studies performed in Great Britain United Kingdom.

The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) is a large population-based, electronic health record (EHR) database.[@herrett2015] containing the primary care records for more than 10 million primary care patients in England, and is broadly representative of the UK population in terms of age, sex and ethnicity.[@herrett2015; @mathur2014]

The CPRD is introduced more fully in Chapter \@ref(). Briefly, a similar approach to the cohort definition as used in Chapter

_The Whitehall II study is a prospective cohort study of 10 308 participants (70% men), aged 35–55 years and recruited between 1985 and 1989 from 20 London-based Civil service departments (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/whitehallII). Clinical examinations have been performed in 1991-1994, 1997-1999, 2002-2004, 2007-2009, 2012-2013, 2015-2016 with the data from circulating metabolomic traits and cognitive testing for the present study obtained from the 1997-1999 clinic phase._ - taken from EN ID: 2140

### Cohorts provided data but ultimately excluded

As highlighted in Figure \@ref(fig:cohortFlowchart), several cohorts from the DPUK responding positively but on inspection of data provided these cohorts were excluded. 

Several cohorts were excluded on the basis of a lack of exposure variables, including Cam-CAN (had cardiovascular category, but only contained blood pressure).

The reasons for exclusion of these cohorts for which data were provided is illustrated in Table \@ref(tab:dataExcluded-table).

Likley had dementia at baseline

Excluded as criteria for entry was outpatients from memory clinic (unlikely to be dementia free at baseline)

### Data cleaning and harmonisation

Across all cohorts, data cleaning was performed in a similar manner, using commonly named variables, so that a single model could be applied using functional programming. 

The one exception to this is the CPRD data, which was held in a different system to the rest.

The advantage of this approach is that it reduces the liklihood of errors in model mis-speciication if needing to change variables names from cohort to cohort.

For all cohorts, the first lipid measurement was used for the exposure method, 

For heterogeneity across the cohorts, the total time-at-risk was investigated.

This review had a low response rate to requests for data access.

While this is not unexpected, given that a review of IPD studies published between 1987 and 2015 found that fewer than half managed to obtained data from greater than 80% of studies, and that in many cases, the exact percentage of studies for which data were obtained was not accurately reported.

Whether or not to press ahead with an IPD analysis in the absence of all (or even most) data is a personal decision, and some have highlighted where they decided not to pursue an IPD study.[@jaspers2014] 

<!-- However, fewer than half of systematic reviews with IPDMA, published between 1987 and 2015, retrieved data from at least 80% of relevant studies and from at least 80% of relevant participants [16]. The number of IPDMAs increased over this period [17], but data retrieval rates remained unchanged [16, 18]. Inability to include eligible studies compromises the systematic review’s purpose, decreases study power, and leads to healthcare decisions based on an incomplete, potentially biased data sample (studies with available data may differ from those whose data are not available) [10, 19, 20]. However, analysis combining individual and study level data may mitigate these effects [3, 21]. from [@ventresca2020a] -->
