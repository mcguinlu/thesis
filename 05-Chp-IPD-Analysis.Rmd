The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) is a large population-based, electronic health record (EHR) database.[@herrett2015] containing the primary care records for more than 10 million primary care patients in England, and is broadly representative of the UK population in terms of age, sex and ethnicity.[@herrett2015; @mathur2014]

The CPRD is introduced more fully in . Briefly, a similar approach to the cohort definition as used in Chapter

_The Whitehall II study is a prospective cohort study of 10 308 participants (70% men), aged 35–55 years and recruited between 1985 and 1989 from 20 London-based Civil service departments (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/whitehallII). Clinical examinations have been performed in 1991-1994, 1997-1999, 2002-2004, 2007-2009, 2012-2013, 2015-2016 with the data from circulating metabolomic traits and cognitive testing for the present study obtained from the 1997-1999 clinic phase._ - taken from EN ID: 2140

### Cohorts provided data but ultimately excluded

Several cohorts were excluded on the basis of a lack of exposure variables, including Cam-CAN (had cardiovascular category, but only contained blood pressure).

This was particularly frustrating in the case of cohorts which had a dedicated data access panel, for example, the Three City Study. Despite multiple attempts to contact the team, there was no response received.

### Limitations

#### Low response rate to request for data

This review had a low response rate to requests for data access.

While this is not unexpected, given that a review of IPD studies published between 1987 and 2015 found that fewer than half managed to obtained data from greater than 80% of studies, and that in many cases, the exact percentage of studies for which data was obtained was not accurately reported.

There are likely several reasons for this. 

* Individual participant data meta-analysis including studies other than randomised controlled trials have less success in obtaining individual participant data from studies.[@nevitt2017a] 

* While there is no

Range of reasons why data is not readily available. Privacy concerns, concerns around scoping or "parasitic" behaviour, and a lack of trust (i.e. primary researchers do not trust secondary researchers).<!-- TODO CITATION NEEDED: paper on trust as a big issue + paper on systematic review of barriers to data sharing -->

Whether or not to press ahead with an IPD analysis in the absence of all (or even most) data is a personal decision, and some have highlighted where they decided not to pursue an IPD study.[@jaspers2014] 




<!-- However, fewer than half of systematic reviews with IPDMA, published between 1987 and 2015, retrieved data from at least 80% of relevant studies and from at least 80% of relevant participants [16]. The number of IPDMAs increased over this period [17], but data retrieval rates remained unchanged [16, 18]. Inability to include eligible studies compromises the systematic review’s purpose, decreases study power, and leads to healthcare decisions based on an incomplete, potentially biased data sample (studies with available data may differ from those whose data are not available) [10, 19, 20]. However, analysis combining individual and study level data may mitigate these effects [3, 21]. from [@ventresca2020a] -->

In future, it could have been worth running a "study within a review", such as that used to examine the best method [@godolphin2019a]
