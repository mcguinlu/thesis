## Introduction

Is there a good way to visualise input of cohorts into an IPD analysis?

## Methods

As part

As part of the IPD analysis, relevant cohort studies were identified from the sty and approached. In the first instance, the corresponding author on the main man

Talk about missing data was handled <!-- IDEA See Sean's thesis for some additional detail on this -->

<!-- Need exact number approach -->

As part of this Chapter, I will use individual patient data from a range of sources. These sources are described here in detail for reference.

Should also include a list of reasons why specific additional cohorts were not included - some like the EHR might be too big to get

Each should have: 

* Description (including observation period, numbers, numbers with outcome, etc)
* Whether they are a known genetically at-risk cohort

#### Whitehall II

_The Whitehall II study is a prospective cohort study of 10 308 participants (70% men), aged 35â€“55 years and recruited between 1985 and 1989 from 20 London-based Civil service departments (https://www.ucl.ac.uk/whitehallII). Clinical examinations have been performed in 1991-1994, 1997-1999, 2002-2004, 2007-2009, 2012-2013, 2015-2016 with the data from circulating metabolomic traits and cognitive testing for the present study obtained from the 1997-1999 clinic phase._ - taken from EN ID: 2140

Several DPUK cohorts were excluded on the basis of a lack of exposure variables, including Cam-CAN (had cardiovascular category, but only contained blood pressure).

### Risk of bias assessment

Risk of bias assessment was performed for each of the included cohorts using the relevant tool described in Section \@ref(risk-of-bias).

## Discussion

Letters sent to all cohorts identified through the systematic review - will need quite a bit here on the numbers approached and how they responded if at all. Will also need to comment on the additional tactics used. 

This is likely due to my junior position as a early career research combined with the impact 



Range of reasons why data is not readily available. Privacy concerns, concerns around scoping or "parasitic" behaviour, and a lack of trust (i.e. primary researchers do not trust secondary researchers).<!-- TODO CITATION NEEDED: paper on trust as a big issue + paper on systematic review of barriers to data sharing -->
 
Unfortunately,
