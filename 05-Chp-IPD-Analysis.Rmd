The Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) is a large population-based, electronic health record (EHR) database.[@herrett2015] containing the primary care records for more than 10 million primary care patients in England, and is broadly representative of the UK population in terms of age, sex and ethnicity.[@herrett2015; @mathur2014]

The CPRD is introduced more fully in . Briefly, a similar approach to the cohort definition as used in Chapter

Additionally, ther number of participants is larger in this analysis as there is no restriction on the level which lipids should be in order to be included in the analysis.

### Cohorts provided data but ultimately excluded

Several cohorts were excluded on the basis of a lack of exposure variables, including Cam-CAN (had cardiovascular category, but only contained blood pressure).

Excluded as criteria for entry was outpatients from memory clinic (unlikely to be dementia free at baseline)

This was particularly frustrating in the case of cohorts which had a dedicated data access panel, for example, the Three City Study. Despite multiple attempts to contact the team, there was no response received.

### Data cleaning

Across all cohorts, data cleaning was performed in a similary manner, using commonly named variables, so that a single model could be applied using functional programming. 

The one exception to this is the CPRD data, which was held in a different system to the rest.

The advantage of this approach is that it reduces the liklihood of errors in model mis-speciication if needing to change variables names from cohort to cohort.



For all cohorts, the first lipid measurement was used for the exposure method, 

For heterogeneity across the cohorts, the total time-at-risk was investigated.

### Limitations

#### Low response rate to request for data

This review had a low response rate to requests for data access.

While this is not unexpected, given that a review of IPD studies published between 1987 and 2015 found that fewer than half managed to obtained data from greater than 80% of studies, and that in many cases, the exact percentage of studies for which data was obtained was not accurately reported.

There are likely several reasons for this.

Range of reasons why data is not readily available.

Whether or not to press ahead with an IPD analysis in the absence of all (or even most) data is a personal decision, and some have highlighted where they decided not to pursue an IPD study.[@jaspers2014] 




<!-- However, fewer than half of systematic reviews with IPDMA, published between 1987 and 2015, retrieved data from at least 80% of relevant studies and from at least 80% of relevant participants [16]. The number of IPDMAs increased over this period [17], but data retrieval rates remained unchanged [16, 18]. Inability to include eligible studies compromises the systematic reviewâ€™s purpose, decreases study power, and leads to healthcare decisions based on an incomplete, potentially biased data sample (studies with available data may differ from those whose data are not available) [10, 19, 20]. However, analysis combining individual and study level data may mitigate these effects [3, 21]. from [@ventresca2020a] -->
