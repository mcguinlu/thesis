# Supplementary Materials {#supp-mat}

## Supplementary Material 1: Changes to protocol {#supp-mat-protocol}

Any changes made to the approved protocol are "Minor amendments" as per the ISAC criteria, specifically falling under the category of "Additional methods to further control for confounding or sensitivity analysis provided these are to be reported as secondary to the main findings".

Main changes include:

-   Use of a time-varying treatment indicator, to correctly classify time-at-risk.
-   Inclusion of additional covariates that are adjusted for in the main model.

# Supplementary tables {#supp-tab}

## Supplementary Table 1: Definition of exposures and covariates

(ref:covariateDef-caption) Definition of covariates adjusted for in the Cox PR model.

The code lists used to define covariates adjusted for in the fully-adjusted model (see Supplementary Table \@ref(tab:covariateDef-table)) were originally created for use in a previous analysis.[@walker2020] Some code lists were built on or adapted from previous published work,[@khan2010; @taylor2016; @wright2017] and these are noted in the table.
