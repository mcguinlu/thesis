### Publications beyond the scope of this thesis {#appendix-publications}

In addition to publications arising directly from this thesis (described in Section \@ref(literature-contributions) & included in Appendix \@ref(published-papers)), I have been involved in a number of external research projects. Taken together, these additional projects provided extensive experience in evidence synthesis methods and in collaborating across large teams.

During 2020, I was involved in the updating of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. My contributions were focused on the data sharing aspects of the guidelines and on building an interactive web application that would allow users to complete the PRISMA checklist. Publications arising from this work are listed below:

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I worked with a team of evidence synthesists to develop a literature searching/screening pipeline. This work underpinned a living systematic review on impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-harm and suicidal behaviour. Subsequently, the pipeline enabled rapid reviews of related topics, such as an analysis of the available evidence by population.

## Chapter 2 {#appendix-sys-rev-tools}

### Code for publication rate analysis {#appendix-tools-pub}

medRxiv automatically links preprints to their published counterparts, and provides the DOI of the published article as part of the metadata on a given preprint. Using `medrxivr` to access this data, I could assess the two-year publication rate of preprints originally posted to medRxiv in July 2019. The code used for this analysis is presented below:

&nbsp;

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load relevant packages
library(medrxivr)
library(dplyr)

# Use snapshot of published status from July 2021
  mx_search(
    mx_snapshot("ccedfb8a44304b9fba4e3ba518a8ce4ed2294770"),
    query = "*",
    # Limit to those 129 records published in July 2019
    from_date = "2019-07-01",
    to_date = "2019-08-01"
  ) %>%
    
# Create indicator to show which records have been published
  mutate(Status = ifelse(published == "NA",
                          "Not published",
                          "Published")) %>%
    
# Group by indicator variable ("Published"/"Not published")
  group_by(Status) %>%
    
# Get total number per group, and percentage of total (N=129)
  summarise(N = n(),
            Percent = comma(n() / 129 * 100)) 
```

&nbsp;

As shown in Table \@ref(tab:medRes-table), two-thirds of preprints were published within two years of their submission to medRxiv.

### Deviations from protocol {#appendix-sys-rev-deviations}

There were a number of deviations from the pre-registered protocol for the systematic review reported in Chapters \@ref(sys-rev-methods-heading) & \@ref(sys-rev-results-heading):[@mcguinnessluke2020] 

* I had originally intended to examine both dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as outcomes of interest. However, given the large number of relevant records for the dementia outcomes, I did not include MCI as an outcome.

* For Mendelian randomisation analyses, I had originally intended to use a panel of experts to assess he risk of bias in this study design. However, through private correspondence with the authors of a review of risk-of-bias assessment tools for Mendelian randomisation studies (since published[@spiga2021]), I became aware of the Mamluk _et al_ tool. Given this tool was considered to be the best available for assessing Mendelian randomisation studies and that it followed a domain-based approach, enabling comparison with tools for other study designs, I decided to use it in the review. 

* I performed an additional assessment of the risk of bias due to missing evidence using the ROB-ME tool. This analysis was not planned because the tool did not exist when the protocol was written.

* I had originally intended to assess sources of funding alongside bias. However, on further reading,[@sterne2013] I learned that any bias introduced by sources of funding would operate through one of the existing domains of the risk-of-bias tools. As such, I did not consider funding sources seperately.
 
 * Finally, I performed a dose response meta-analysis to assess the evidence for a non-linear realtionship between lipids and dementia outcomes. This marked a departure from the published protocol, as I had not expected the number of studies reporting dementia risk across lipid sub-categories to be sufficient for a dose response analysis.

### Code to search preprints {#appendix-medrxivr-code}

<!-- TODO Double check this is the final code used -->

As detailed extensively in the main text, the inclusion of preprinted literature was a key aspect of the review presented in Chapters \@ref(sys-rev-methods-heading) & \@ref(sys-rev-results-heading). Using the `medrxivr` tool presented in Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-tools-heading). 

Given the relatively small number of records contained in the preprint server, no study design filters were employed. For the same reason, the number of search terms is smaller compared with the main database searches, as terms returning no records have been removed. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

library(medrxivr)

# Define exposure search terms
topic1 <- c(mx_caps("statin"),
            mx_caps("ldl"),
            mx_caps("hdl"),

### Calculating Gwet's AC1 {#appendix-gwet}

Gwet's agreement coefficient, $AC1$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
AC1 = \frac{observed\;agreement-chance\;agreement}{1-chance\;agreement}
  (\#eq:AC1-words)
\end{equation}

In reference to a two-by-two table with cells A, B, C and D, it is calculated using the following:

\begin{equation}
  AC1 = \frac{\frac{A+D}{N}-e(\gamma)}{1-e(\gamma)}
  (\#eq:AC1-main)
\end{equation}

where $e(\gamma)$ is the chance agreement between raters, given as $2q(1-q)$, where 

\begin{equation}
  q = \frac{(A+C)+(A+B)}{2N}
  (\#eq:AC1-supp)
\end{equation}

### Dose response plots by fraction {#appendix-dr-fraction}

## Chapter 7 {#appendix-tri-analysis}

### Calculation of average adjustment values from previous expert elicitation exercise {#appendix-adjustment-values}

The paper describing the bias/indirectness-adjusted meta-analysis method used expert elicitation to define a distribution for  bias and indirectness across eight studies examining the effectiveness of routine anti-D prophylaxis in Rhesus negative women.[@turner2009] The authors consider five sources of bias (selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, detection bias and other bias) and four sources of indirectness (population, intervention, control, outcome). For each domain of bias/indirectness, four experts were asked to define the 67% interval around the effect expected due to bias/indirectness in the absence of a true effect. Additive or multiplicative scales were used to capture the intervals for additive and proportional bias/indirectness, respectively. The authors then use assumed log-normality of these distributions to derive a mean and variance for each on the log scale.

In an attempt to inform the prior distributions used in the triangulation exercise presented in Chapter \@ref(tri-heading), I first averaged the mean and variance values across the four experts for each source of bias/indirectness within each study. I averaged the absolute value of the mean, as I wanted to obtain the average adjustment regardless of direction of adjustment which was indicated using the sign of the mean in the original analysis).

I then took the average and maximum of these averaged mean and variance values. The distributions arising from this analysis are presented in Table \@ref(tab:turnerEstimates-table). The two step approach (averaging across assessors before taking the average/maximum across sources of bias) was important. While the final mean values will be the same whichever approach is taken, in a one-step process the maximum value can be artificially inflated by a single expert's estimate. Averaging across experts for a given bias in a given study before taking the maximum value across biases and studies prevented this.

&nbsp;

The mean values shown were used to define the distributions assigned to  "Moderate" bias/indirectness judgements in my analysis (see Tables \@ref(tab:priorsAdd-table) & \@ref(tab:priorsIndirect-table)).

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

### Comparison of two scenarios of bias

As discussed in the main text, I defined two sets of additive bias distributions as a sensitivity analysis. The results for the two case studies under the two scenarios are presented in the figures below.

(ref:fpLdlAdComparison-cap) Comparison of bias-/indirectness-adjusted meta-analyses of LDL-c/Alzheimer's disease, using two different scenarios for the relationship of levels of bias. The left forest plot shows the result where the difference in mean value between the "High" and "Moderate" bias levels is the same as between the "Moderate" and "Low" levels. In the right plot, the difference in mean value between "High" and "Moderate" is twice that between "Moderate" and "Low".

### Reproducible research {#disc-repro-research}

All software projects in these thesis attempt to conform to minimal best practices for research computing. [@wilson2014; @wilson2017]

Reproducible and science has been a key theme running through this thesis, as reflected by the development of an open source tool to help search medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint metadata. In line with this, an open source copy of the code used to produce this thesis is available on GitHub, as is the code used to perform the analysis contained within it. 

Unfortunately, given the. However, as discussed in other chapters of this thesis and elsewhere, sharing of analysis code is a useful step towards transparency when the underlying datasets are not readily available.

Commentary on the fact that the best you can do is replicate vs reproducible (due the closed nature of the data).

One is the ability to recreate the results given the same data and code, the other is the ability to recreate the results given the same code but a different dataset. IN theory it is possible to gain access the dataset given the information presented in Chapter \@(ref:cprd-analysis-heading). However, access is dependency on an ISAC application to the managing body of the CPRD. 


### Catalogue of failures {#appendix-catalogue-failures}

Short section detailing the things I tried to do but which did not work:

- Failed to properly scope the literature and correctly estimate the number of studies returned by the search

- Failed IV analysis of anti-HC drugs because of low numbers of non-statins.

- Failed to realise that the initial code list used for the positive control outcome of IHD in the CPRD analysis (Chapter \@ref(cprd-analysis-heading))

- Unsuccessful grant application with Andy

- Unsuccessful grant application with Chris Penfold

- Unsuccessful grant application with Matt

- Instrumental variable analysis of lipid regulation use using physicians prescribing preference. 

- 2 x unsuccessful conference abstracts

The robvis package provides functions to convert a risk-of-bias assessment summary table into a summary plot or a traffic-light plot, formatted based on the specific risk-of-bias assessment tool used.

robvis currently contains templates for the following tools:

* ROB2
* ROBINS-I
* QUADAS-2
* ROB1

For the direction bias plots, the data expected by the tools is more comprehensive.
