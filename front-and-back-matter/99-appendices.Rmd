### Publications beyond the scope of this thesis {#appendix-publications}

In addition to publications arising directly from this thesis (described in Section \@ref(literature-contributions) & included in Appendix \@ref(published-papers)), I have been involved in a number of external research projects. Taken together, these additional projects provided extensive experience in evidence synthesis methods and in collaborating across large teams.

During 2020, I was involved in the updating of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. My contributions were focused on the data sharing aspects of the guidelines and on building an interactive web application that would allow users to complete the PRISMA checklist. Publications arising from this work are listed below:

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I worked with a team of evidence synthesists to develop a literature searching/screening pipeline. This work underpinned a living systematic review on impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-harm and suicidal behaviour. Subsequently, the pipeline enabled rapid reviews of related topics, such as an analysis of the available evidence by population.

## Chapter 2 {#appendix-sys-rev-tools}

### Code for publication rate analysis {#appendix-tools-pub}

medRxiv automatically links preprints to their published counterparts, and provides the DOI of the published article as part of the metadata on a given preprint. Using `medrxivr` to access this data, I could assess the two-year publication rate of preprints originally posted to medRxiv in July 2019. The code used for this analysis is presented below:

&nbsp;

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load relevant packages
library(medrxivr)
library(dplyr)

# Use snapshot of published status from July 2021
  mx_search(
    mx_snapshot("ccedfb8a44304b9fba4e3ba518a8ce4ed2294770"),
    query = "*",
    # Limit to those 129 records published in July 2019
    from_date = "2019-07-01",
    to_date = "2019-08-01"
  ) %>%
    
# Create indicator to show which records have been published
  mutate(Status = ifelse(published == "NA",
                          "Not published",
                          "Published")) %>%
    
# Group by indicator variable ("Published"/"Not published")
  group_by(Status) %>%
    
# Get total number per group, and percentage of total (N=129)
  summarise(N = n(),
            Percent = comma(n() / 129 * 100)) 
```

&nbsp;

As shown in Table \@ref(tab:medRes-table), two-thirds of preprints were published within two years of their submission to medRxiv.

### Deviations from protocol {#appendix-sys-rev-deviations}

There were a number of deviations from the pre-registered protocol for the systematic review reported in Chapters \@ref(sys-rev-methods-heading) & \@ref(sys-rev-results-heading):[@mcguinnessluke2020] 

* I had originally intended to examine both dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as outcomes of interest. However, given the large number of relevant records for the dementia outcomes, I did not include MCI as an outcome.

* For Mendelian randomisation analyses, I had originally intended to use a panel of experts to assess he risk of bias in this study design. However, through private correspondence with the authors of a review of risk-of-bias assessment tools for Mendelian randomisation studies (since published[@spiga2021]), I became aware of the Mamluk _et al_ tool. Given this tool was considered to be the best available for assessing Mendelian randomisation studies and that it followed a domain-based approach, enabling comparison with tools for other study designs, I decided to use it in the review. 

* I performed an additional assessment of the risk of bias due to missing evidence using the ROB-ME tool. This analysis was not planned because the tool did not exist when the protocol was written.

* I had originally intended to assess sources of funding alongside bias. However, on further reading,[@sterne2013] I learned that any bias introduced by sources of funding would operate through one of the existing domains of the risk-of-bias tools. As such, I did not consider funding sources seperately.
 
 * Finally, I performed a dose response meta-analysis to assess the evidence for a non-linear realtionship between lipids and dementia outcomes. This marked a departure from the published protocol, as I had not expected the number of studies reporting dementia risk across lipid sub-categories to be sufficient for a dose response analysis.

### Code to search preprints {#appendix-medrxivr-code}

<!-- TODO Double check this is the final code used -->

As detailed extensively in the main text, the inclusion of preprinted literature was a key aspect of the review presented in Chapters \@ref(sys-rev-methods-heading) & \@ref(sys-rev-results-heading). Using the `medrxivr` tool presented in Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-tools-heading). 

Given the relatively small number of records contained in the preprint server, no study design filters were employed. For the same reason, the number of search terms is smaller compared with the main database searches, as terms returning no records have been removed. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}

library(medrxivr)

# Define exposure search terms
topic1 <- c(mx_caps("statin"),
            mx_caps("ldl"),
            mx_caps("hdl"),
            mx_caps("TG"),
            mx_caps("triglycer"),

### Calculating Gwet's AC1 {#appendix-gwet}

Gwet's agreement coefficient, $AC1$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
AC1 = \frac{observed\;agreement-chance\;agreement}{1-chance\;agreement}
  (\#eq:AC1-words)
\end{equation}

In reference to a two-by-two table with cells A, B, C and D, it is calculated using the following:

\begin{equation}
  AC1 = \frac{\frac{A+D}{N}-e(\gamma)}{1-e(\gamma)}
  (\#eq:AC1-main)
\end{equation}

where $e(\gamma)$ is the chance agreement between raters, given as $2q(1-q)$, where 

\begin{equation}
  q = \frac{(A+C)+(A+B)}{2N}
  (\#eq:AC1-supp)
\end{equation}

## Chapter 5 {#appendix-cprd-analysis}

### Amendments to protocol {#appendix-cprd-amendments}

Any changes made to the approved protocol are "Minor amendments" as per the ISAC criteria, specifically falling under the category of "Additional methods to further control for confounding or sensitivity analysis provided these are to be reported as secondary to the main findings".

Changes include:

-   Use of a time-varying treatment indicator, to correctly classify time-at-risk.
-   Inclusion of additional covariates that are adjusted for in the main model.

### Minimum follow-up period {#cprd-min-fu}

Enforcing a minimum period of follow-up is normally used to reduce the risk of reverse causation in an analysis by excluding events occurring within a certain time-frame post-exposure. With respect to dementia outcomes, which have a long prodomal period, enforcing a minimum period of follow-up can add biological validity to an analysis. Incident cases of dementia that occur within a few years of starting a drug may already be beyond effective preventive treatment at the time the drug was started, and so restricting the analysis to those with longer exposure to treatment may provide a more reliable estimate of the effect.

Panel A of Figure \@ref(fig:minFU) describes a standard analysis of an exposure with a minimum enforced follow-up period (in this case, 10 years). Participants enter the cohort and are classified at that point as either exposed or unexposed, for example, on the basis of a total cholesterol measurement. Participants are followed-up over time, but events occuring before the minimum period of follow-up are discarded.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
```{r minFollowUp, include = FALSE}
```

(ref:minFU-cap) Diagram illustrating the design of two studies. Panel A shows a study in which all participants enter the study and are assinged an exposure group at the same time, making it ease to define a minimum period of follow-up. In contrast, Panel B illustrates the time- varying analysis used in Chapter \@ref(cprd-analysis-heading), which makes it challenging to define an unbiased minimum period of follow-up.

(ref:minFU-scap) Illustration of minimum follow-up period in two study designs

```{r minFU, echo = FALSE, results="asis", fig.pos = "H", fig.cap='(ref:minFU-cap)', out.width='100%', fig.scap='(ref:minFU-scap)'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures/appendix/minFU.png"))
```
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

However, applying a similar approach to the analysis performed in Chapter \@ref(cprd-analysis-heading), illustrated in Panel B of Figure \@ref(fig:minFU), is challenging. The use of a time updating treatment indicator results in two potential starting points for the 10-year lag: entry into the cohort or initiation of statin therapy. As the purpose of this analysis is to investigate the impact of statin treatment, starting the minimum period of follow-up from cohort entry is not helpful as it does not ensure that participants have been exposed to the drug for 10 years. Alternatively, defining the minimum period of follow-up from statin initiation cause issues around the treatment of time-at-risk before statin initiation and around the start point for the follow-up period in those never prescribed a statin. In summary, either approach is likely to be substantially biased.

With these caveats in mind, below I present a sensitivity analysis of the association of statins with dementia outcomes, enforcing a minimum 10-year period of follow-up from statin initiation in those prescribed a statin. 

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
(ref:cprdMinFu-cap) Sensitivity analysis showing the results of a re-analysis of the CPRD data enforcing a minimum follow-up period of 10 years in the statin group. Events occurring within 10 years of inititating statins were discarded, but the participant-time-at-risk was maintained. No minimum follow-up period was applied in those never taking a statin, due to the difficulties in defining the start date for the follow-up period, as discussed in the text above.

## Chapter 7 {#appendix-tri-analysis}

### Calculation of average adjustment values from previous expert elicitation exercise {#appendix-adjustment-values}

The paper describing the bias/indirectness-adjusted meta-analysis method used expert elicitation to define a distribution for  bias and indirectness across eight studies examining the effectiveness of routine anti-D prophylaxis in Rhesus negative women.[@turner2009] The authors consider five sources of bias (selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, detection bias and other bias) and four sources of indirectness (population, intervention, control, outcome). For each domain of bias/indirectness, four experts were asked to define the 67% interval around the effect expected due to bias/indirectness in the absence of a true effect. Additive or multiplicative scales were used to capture the intervals for additive and proportional bias/indirectness, respectively. The authors then use assumed log-normality of these distributions to derive a mean and variance for each on the log scale.

The resulting data for two domains of bias (attrition and detection) in one study are shown in Table \@ref(tab:addTable1-table).

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  
(ref:addTable1-caption) Distributions of bias, defined by position and variance terms, assigned by four independent experts to attrition and detection bias in a single study. This data was obtained from a previous publication,[@turner2009] and represents an illustrative subset of the larger dataset. 

(ref:addTable1-scaption) addTable1

```{r addTable1-table, message=FALSE, results="asis", echo = FALSE}
```
&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

In an attempt to inform the prior distributions used in the triangulation exercise presented in Chapter \@ref(tri-heading), I first averaged the position and variance values across the four experts for each source of bias/indirectness within each study. I took the average of the absolute of the position value, as I wanted to obtain the average adjustment regardless of direction. The results of this process for the example data presented below are shown in Table \@ref(tab:addTable2-table).

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  
(ref:addTable2-caption) Position and variance values for two example bias domains (attritiona and detection), obtained by averaging the absolute of the values contained in \@ref(tab:addTable3-table) across the four reviewers.

(ref:addTable2-scaption) addTable1

```{r addTable2-table, message=FALSE, results="asis", echo = FALSE}
```
&nbsp;<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------> 

I then took the average and maximum of the expert-averaged position and variance values. The results of this for the example data are presented in Table \@ref(tab:addTable3-table). 

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  
(ref:addTable3-caption) Mean and maximum of position and variance values desribed in Table \@ref(tab:addTable3-table)

(ref:addTable3-scaption) addTable1

```{r addTable3-table, message=FALSE, results="asis", echo = FALSE}
```
&nbsp;<!-----------------------------------------------------------------------> 

This two step approach (averaging across assessors before taking the average and maximum across domains/studies) was important. While the final average values will be the same whichever approach is taken, in a one-step process, the maximum value can be artificially inflated by a single expert's estimate. For example, in the illustrative data subset above, Assessor 2 assigns a distribution of N(-0.32,0.14), which would double the maximum position (0.16) and triple the maximum variance (0.0475) obtained when first averaging across experts.

The distributions arising from this applying this approach to the entire dataset, stratified by bias/indirectness and additive/proportional effects, are presented in Table \@ref(tab:turnerEstimates-table).

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  
(ref:turnerEstimates-caption) Mean and maximum distributions for bias and indirectness obtained from data resulting from the elicitation exercise reported in _Turner et al_[@turner2009]. Note I did not calculate values for additive indirectness, as in my analysis, all indirectness was assumed to be proportional.

(ref:turnerEstimates-scaption) turnerEstimates

```{r turnerEstimates-table, message=FALSE, results="asis", echo = FALSE}
```
&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

The mean values shown were used to define the distributions assigned to  "Moderate" bias/indirectness judgements in my analysis (see Tables \@ref(tab:priorsAdd-table) & \@ref(tab:priorsIndirect-table)).

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

### Comparison of two scenarios of bias

As discussed in the main text, I defined two sets of additive bias distributions as a sensitivity analysis. The results for the two case studies under the two scenarios are presented in the figures below. Under the first, shown on the left of the subsequent  forest plot, the difference in the position value between the distributions assigned to "High" and "Moderate" bias levels is the same as between the "Moderate" and "Low" levels.

## Chapter 8

### Reproducible research {#disc-repro-research}

Reproducible and science has been a key theme running through this thesis, as reflected by the development of an open source tools to search preprinted literature, create visualisations of risk-of-bias data and to preform quantitative triangulation. In line with this, an open source copy of the code used to produce this thesis is available on GitHub, as is the code used to perform the analysis contained within it. 

Unfortunately, given the nature of the data underpinning the CPRD (Chapter \@ref(cprd-analysis-heading)) and IPD (Chapter \@ref(ipd-heading)) analyses, it is not possible to make it publicly available. Access to the CPRD data is dependent on an application to its managing body, while acces to the cohorts within the DPUK requires approval from both the DPUK and inidividual cohort owners. In the absence of data sharing, the best option to enable review and increase transparency is the open sharing of the code used to perform the analysis.[@goldacre2019]

Finally, all software projects in these thesis attempt to conform to minimal best practices for research computing. [@wilson2014; @wilson2017]

### Catalogue of failures {#appendix-catalogue-failures}

OVer the course of my PhD, I kept a record of attempted

Short section detailing the things I tried to do but which did not work:

- Failed to properly scope the literature and correctly estimate the number of studies returned by the search

- Failed IV analysis of anti-HC drugs because of low numbers of non-statins.

- Failed to realise that the initial code list used for the positive control outcome of IHD in the CPRD analysis (Chapter \@ref(cprd-analysis-heading))

- Unsuccessful grant application with Andy

- Unsuccessful grant application with Chris Penfold

- Unsuccessful grant application with Matt

- Instrumental variable analysis of lipid regulation use using physicians prescribing preference. 

- 2 x unsuccessful conference abstracts

## Software used to create this thesis

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::write_bib(c(.packages(), "bookdown", "knitr"), here::here("bibliography/packages.bib"))
```

<!-- TODO These citations are not rendering properly - I think because bookdown using this latex format only allows 1 .bib file. -->

This thesis was written in RMarkdown using the RStudio integrated development environment. Several R packages were used as part of this project.`r gen_rmd_citation("packages.bib")` The version number of these packages is shown below:

## Producing risk-of-bias visualisations with `robvis` {#appendix-robvis}

<!-- TODO Need to complete this sections -->
The robvis package provides functions to convert a risk-of-bias assessment summary table into a summary plot or a traffic-light plot, formatted based on the specific risk-of-bias assessment tool used.

### Templates

`robvis` currently contains templates for the following tools:

* ROB2
* ROBINS-I
* QUADAS-2
* ROB1
* General

### Data expectations

For the direction bias plots, the data expected by the tools is more comprehensive.

&nbsp;

\blandscape
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
(ref:biasData-caption) First five assessments contained in `data_rob2`, an example dataset for the Risk of Bias 2 tool for randomised controlled trials available via the `robvis` package.

(ref:biasData-scaption) biasData

```{r biasData-table, message=FALSE, results="asis", echo = FALSE}
```
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

&nbsp;

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
(ref:biasDirectionData-caption) Example data illustrating the structure required for bias direction plots. $d_ij$, $d_id$, and $d_it$ define the extent (Serious, Moderate, Low), direction (right or left), and type (additive or proportional) of bias in the $i$th domain. Note that, because of the wide nature of the data, I have abbreviated the data in order to display it. A key for interpreting the data can be found below the table.

(ref:biasDirectionData-scaption) biasDirectionData

### Simple visualisations

```{r robAppendixFigures, include = FALSE}
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rob_summary(data = data_rob2, tool = "ROB2")
```

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
(ref:robSummary-cap) Illustration of a simple summary barplot created using the `data_rob` example risk-of-bias dataset shown in Table \@ef(tab:biasData-table) above. Note that this plot is unweighted and shows the _proportion of studies_ at each level of bias, but an option exists with `robvis` to create a barplot weighted by the _proportion of evidence_ at each level of bias. 

(ref:robSummary-scap) Example risk-of-bias summary barplot

```{r robSummary, echo = FALSE, results="asis", fig.pos = "H", fig.cap='(ref:robSummary-cap)', out.width='80%', fig.scap='(ref:robSummary-scap)'}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures/appendix/robSummary.png"))
```
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rob_traffic_light(data = data_rob2,
                  tool = "ROB2",
                  psize = 10)
```

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
(ref:robTraffic-cap) Illustration of a simple traffic light plot created using the `data_rob` example risk-of-bias dataset shown in Table \@ef(tab:biasData-table) above.

(ref:robTraffic-scap) Example risk-of-bias traffic-light plot

```{r robTraffic, echo = FALSE, results="asis", fig.pos = "H", fig.cap='(ref:robTraffic-cap)', out.width='80%', fig.scap='(ref:robTraffic-scap)'}
