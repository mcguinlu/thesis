__Professional__

First and foremost, I must thank my primary supervisor, Julian Higgins, for his tireless support and encouragement. I'd also like to thank my other supervisors - Yoav Ben-Shlomo, Liz Coulthard and George Davey-Smith - for all their input over the past three years. Thanks also to Rupert Payne and Emma Anderson for their engaging discussion and useful feedback during my annual progress reviews.

I am extremely grateful to all those who contributed their time and energy to my research projects: Athena Sheppard, Emily Hennessy, Matthew Lee, Lena Schmidt, Alexandra McAleenan, Vincent Cheng, Francesca Spiga, Sarah Dawson and Rebecca Turner. A special mention goes to Mark Newbury of the Dementia Platform UK, who supported my applications for data access - I am extremely grateful for his help and commitment in chasing cohort owners.

I also want to thank the many people who raised issues or otherwise provided feedback on the open-source tools built as part of this thesis - it's been a joy to watch others build on my work. A special mention must go to Randall Boyes and Alex J Fowler for their input/work on the `robvis` tool.

__Personal__

Ciara, I'd need (at least) another 48,351 words to accurately describe all the ways in which you supported me through this endeavour. It can't have been fun being locked down in a small flat with a grumpy and stressed PhD student, nor trying to support the same student remotely from Dublin. In the Discussion, I talk about lessons learned during this thesis, but the biggest takeaway of this whole experience for me is that I am incredibly lucky to have found you and to get to take on life while holding your hand. Thank you and I love you.

Mum and Dad, thank you for your never-ending love and support. Everything I am comes from you, and you've done so much to get me to the point where a PhD thesis seemed possible.

There are several people without whom I would not have survived the process of writing a dissertation during COVID times. Ben, Doug, Christin - thank you! 

Finally, a big thanks to Vivienne Gardiner, who sacrificed a substantial amount of time to proof-reading this thesis.
