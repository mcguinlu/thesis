Identification of causal relationships between modifiable targets and risk of dementia is central to the development of evidence-based prevention strategies. Blood lipid levels have been implicated in the aetiology of dementia by genetic linkage and functional cell biology studies, but current epidemiological evidence has yet to reach a consensus on their role in dementia risk. This thesis sought to triangulate the causal effects of lipid levels on dementia (all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia) risk using existing and new evidence.

I conducted four distinct analyses as part of this thesis. Firstly, a systematic review of 81 published and preprinted studies was used to summarise the existing evidence base. Preprinted studies were identified using a research tool developed as part of this thesis. I then supplemented the existing evidence via two primary studies: i) a cohort study of the association of lipid regulating agents and dementia incidence in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), and ii) an individual patient data meta-analysis of the association of blood lipids with dementia incidence in previously unanalysed cohorts accessed through the Dementia Platform UK. Finally, I used a novel quantitative triangulation framework to incorporate the results produced by the diverse methodological approaches while attempting to account for their respective biases and indirectness.

Overall I identified no consistent effect of any lipid fraction on any dementia outcome across the evidence sources presented in this thesis, through there was some suggestion of a protective effect of LDL-c lowering (via statin use) on all-cause dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and a harmful effect of raised triglyceride levels on vascular dementia. However, when assessed through the triangulation framework, both of these effects attenuated to the null. There was a noticeable absence of existing studies considering vascular dementia as an outcome, and 

Future work should focus on defining
