## Lay summary

Triangulation is the practice of using multiple sources of evidence to provide more reliable answers to a research question. Different sources of evidence will have different limitations. If the result from each source points towards the same answer, this improves our confidence in the conclusion.

## Introduction

This chapter will attempt to triangulate the evidence identified by the systematic review in Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-heading-results), with the the results from the analysis of CPRD data (Chapter \@ref(cprd-heading) and IPD \@ref(ipd-heading).

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->

### Overview of triangulation {#triangulation-overview}

Aetiological triangulation, or simply triangulation, is the process of comparing and contrasting across result in order to . 

It has been widely used in the literature, and is comparable to Bradford-Hill's criteria of "consistency", that is the replication of an observed relationship across several different contexts.[@hill1965] A good working definition of the triangulation is:

> The practice of strengthening causal inferences by integrating results from several different approaches, where each approach has different (and assumed to be largely unrelated) key sources of potential bias.[@lawlor2016]

This represents a significant step forward from the current evidence synthesis practice of synthesising evidence from only one approach (e.g. RCT, observational study, etc.). 

However, previous attempts at triangulation have ignored the potential for varying and opposing sources of bias within an approach, assigning a level and direction of bias to entire categories of studies. 

Recent development in bias assessment have a allowed fro a much more granular consideration of the threats to the internal validity of a result. 

For example, while it may be true that all non-randomised studies share some _minimal level_ of bias, investigation of the biases applicable to each individual result gives useful additional information, and is essential for any attempt at quantitative triangulation. 

This chapter, in addition to providing a narrative comparison of the existing and new evidence identified in this thesis, attempts to combine the results numerically by building on existing work on this topic.

In the following section, I define important terms used throughout this chapter.

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->

### Terminology {#tri-terminology}

<!-- Discuss and defined three things: -->

<!-- * Qualitative vs quantitative triangulation -->
<!-- * Bias vs. indirectness -->
<!-- * Additive vs proportion effect of bias/indirectness -->

__Different types of triangulation__

Triangulation exercises can be characterised as either qualitative or quantitative. 

_Qualitative_ triangulation is describing the different results. It regularly appears though not under that name, in the discussion of results section under the name "comparison with other literature". 

In contrast, _quantitative triangulation_ attempts to obtain a overall numerical result by synthesising the different types of evidence. This method is in its infancy, given important methodological challenges that are illustrated in this Chapter.

Both 

Bias (or internal bias) in the result is defined as systematic deviation from result the "idealised" version of the study (that is, )

In contrast, the indirectness of the result (also called generalisability or applicability) is defined here as the discrepancy between the research question addressed by the "idealised" study and the causal question of interest. Problems with indirectness can be arise from differences in population, intervention/exposure, outcomes and 

Of note, the original method employed in this chapter refers indirectness as "external bias" - however. This distinction is important, as bias and indirectness describe two different issues, and referring to both as bias

In addition, indirectness is the widely used term, including by widely-adopted methods such as the GRADE framework.[@guyatt2011]

__Additive vs proportional effects__

The effects of both bias and indirectness can be either additive or propotional.

Additive bias/indirectness is

Both bias and indirectness can be defined as additive or propotional. Additive bias/indirectness is that which can shift the p

## Methods
### Data sources {#tri-data-sources}

As outlined in the thesis overview presented in Section \@ref(background-thesis-overview), this triangulation exercise draws on the research produced in each of the preceding chapters. More specifically, this chapter builds on the comprehensive systematic review presented in chapter \@re(sys-rev-heading), and incorporates the results of the analyses presented in Chapters \@ref(cprd-heading) (assocation of statins with dementia outcomes in the CPRD) & \@ref(ipd-heading) (association of lipids with dementia outcomes in IPD).

Table \@ref(tab:thesisOverview-table) illustrates the causal question each approach has attempted to address, along with the exposures and outcomes for each.

### Qualitative triangulation

As a first step to triangulating the available evidence, all information sources were grouped by outcome, and systematically compared and contrasted. Potential reasons for heterogeneity between study designs were examined with specific reference to the risk-of-bias assessments performed. 

<!-- TODO Use the fact that it doesn't make sense to qualitatively compare at the single result level to highlight the need for a more quantitative approach - usually default to summary at the -->

<!-- IDEA Note the text by Turner on the fact that you can just adjust for a single type of bias - a good example of this would be to try and adjust for internal biases so you get the best possible estimate and then apply it to something like a assumed life-course model - steal from NIHR text, and refer to the appendix  -->  

This analysis built on the detailed risk of bias assessments performed and presented as part of the systematic review (Chapter \@ref()/\@ref()). Similarly, risk-of-bias assessments were performed for each new source of evidence presented in this thesis, details of which are available in Appendix \@ref(?).

<!-- TODO Need to actually do these, and include results in the analysis. -->

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

### Quantitative triangulation

In addition to the qualitative discussion of evidence, I attempted to integrate the numerical results of the multiple approaches. This proof-of-concept approach incorporated advancements in the way that bias in results is assessed (domain-based assessment tools) and existing methods for bias-adjusted meta-analysis[@turner2009] to to illustrate how causal questions could be addressed under this quantitative triangulation framework.

Several steps were used to accomplish this approach, as described in the following sections. In summary these steps are:

1. Define the causal question of interest
1. Identify of relevant evidence sources
1. Assess(and visualise) the extent and direction of bias in each result
1. Define modifying terms for bias and indirectness in each result
1. Perform bias-adjusted meta-analysis using bias-adjusted results

The approach was implemented for two causal questions of interest, as defined below.

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

#### Definition of the causal questions of interest (case-studies)

<!-- TODO See ROBINS-E for this, as to how to think about exposures, adn the "Duration and timing of exposure being assessed with different approachesDuration and timing of exposure being assessed with different approaches" section of the aetiological triangulation -->

This was also guided by the forthcoming ROBINS-E tool, which has

*	Effect of average exposure to LDL-c during midlife on AD 
* Effect of late-life LDL-c on all-cause dementia

&nbsp;

<!-- TODO This table will describe the causal questions of interest, following the ROBINS-E framework as columns, and list the included studies adn the relative weights of each. -->


&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

####	Identify relevant studies

Once the causal question of interest had been defined, studies related to it were 

individual results were obtained from the general evidence sources described in Section \@ref(tri-data-sources)

In order to illustrate the bias-/indirectness adjustment process detailed in the subsequent sections, the process for calculating the adjusted estimate for a single study is described in detail for a single study. Following this, the process was applied to the two subsets of studies related to the causal questions of interest.

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

####	Assess risk and direction of bias in each result

The risk of bias tools used to assess each result are described in detail in Section \@ref(risk-of-bias). In summary, randomized controlled trials were assessed using the RoB 2 tool;[@sterne2019] non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSI), were assessed using the ROBINS-I tool;[@sterne2016]

For the sake of consistency, I mapped the different acceptable judgements in each risk-of-bias tool to a harmonised set of judgements: "Low", "Moderate","High". The exact mapping can be seen in Table \@ref(tab:robLevelsMapping-table). Of note, no mapping was performed for the critical risk-of-bias levels present in the tools for non-randomised studies. This is because current best practice in evidence synthesis is to exclude all studies at critical risk of bias for further quantitative synthesis. <!-- TODO CITATION NEEDED -->

(ref:robLevelsMapping-caption) robLevelsMapping

(ref:robLevelsMapping-scaption) robLevelsMapping

```{r robLevelsMapping-table, message=FALSE, results="asis", echo = FALSE}
```
&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

In addition to assessing the extent of bias in each domain, as defined by the three levels detailed above, I attempted to records the direction of the bias, so that it could feed into the triangulation.

This was achieved via an additional question at the end of each bias domain, which asked assessors to predict the expected direction of bias in that domain. Note that this question is only apply to existing tools (ROB2/ROBINS-I/ROBINS-E), but I employed an identical approach during assessment of Mendelian randomisation studies. This optional question response were: 

* "Favours experimental"/"Favours comparator" (additive bias)
* "Towards null"/"Away from null" (proportional bias)
* "Unpredictable"

As indicated in the options above, the response t this prompt is used both to define the direction and type (additive or proportional) of bias (see ).

Additive biases (identified by a "Favours experimental"/"Favours comparator" response) are XXXX. A key example of additive bias is immortal time bias, which will always favour the intervention.

Proportional biases (identified by a "Towards null"/"Away from null" response) are those related to the magnitude of the effect. A key example of this type of bias is non-differential misclassification bias, which will bias the effect estimate towards the null.

When predicting the direction of effect

From these response the direction of effect was calculated. For additive biases, this was simply a case of shifting the effect estimate to the left or right. For proportional biases, decide

For example, the direction of the bias when the direction of bias is thought to favour the intervention/exposure will be be same regardless of the position of the point estimate. The same is not true for the "Towards the null"/"Away from the null" options.

For example, if the effect estimate represents a protective effect (below the null), then bias towards the null would be represented by a right pointing arrow (Figure \@ref(fig:)). In contrast, if the effect of the intervention is harmful (effect estimate above the null), bias towards the null will be represented by a right-pointing arrow. The program to create these figures thus requires knowledge of both the predicted direction of bias and the effect estimate.

However, 

S

Highlight that this is slightly different for the confounding domain in non-randomised studies, which only allows for the "Favours experimental", "Favours comparator", and "Unpredictable" options.

Of note, the guidance for the tools suggests that if assessors are not able to articulate why the bias in a given domain will "pull" the observed estimate in a specific direction, they should not try to guess. 

To assess the usefulness of this system, the number of domains for which bias was expected (i.e. judged to be a more than Low risk of bias) but for which no expected direction could be identified were expressed as a percentage. If this percentage is high, the helpfulness of the approach is 

<!-- TODO text -->

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

#### Visualisation of extent and direction of bias

To aid with the triangulation exercise and to act as, I created a new method of presentation of the extent/direction bias asessment results to enable detailed comparison across different studies contributing to the synthesis. While these figures do not 

Similar to the standard paired forest plots introduced in Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-), the level of bias across the domains in each study is reported using coloured blocks. However, in contrast to the previous plots, arrows are used in place to illustrate the predicted direction of bias in that domain, categorised as pulling towards the left or the right.

This second aspect required some additional consideration, given the distinct and competing options available to assessors. 

Tha

Helper functions in the forthcoming `triangulate` package - see Appendix \@ref() - help to preprocess risk of bias data for use with both bias-direction plots and adjusted meta-analyses. These bias direction plots themselves were created using the risk of bias isualisation tool described in Appendix \ref().

<!-- TODO include illustrative example here -->

Where the direction of bias was unclear/could not be determined from the report, this is indicated by a dash.

<!-- TODO Does immortal time bias not also have a consistent effect? yes, but inception bias does not necessarily -->

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

####	Assign modifying values to risk/direction of bias

<!-- TODO Note that they are on the log scale - Lines 45-50 of addbias -->

For example, for a "High" additive bias in $j$th domain of the $i$th study is deifined as $\delta_{i,j}^{\mathrm{High}}$ and uncertainty around this estimate is given by a distribution

\begin{equation}
  \delta_{i,j}^{\mathrm{High}} = f(\mu_{i,j}^{\mathrm{High}}, \sigma_{i,j}^{\mathrm{High}})
  (\#eq:name)
\end{equation}


The sign of $\mu_{i,j}^{\mathrm{High}}$ is defined by the relative direction of the bias in relation to the point estimate. If the bias is expected to pull the effect to the left, the position is given a negative sign, and if it is expected to pull the effect to the right, it is given a positive sign.

One key feature of the domain-based risk-of-bias domains is that the domains are considered interchangeable - i.e. a "high" bias in one domain is equivalent to a "high" bias in any other. As such, for this analysis, I assumed that the distributions assigned to each level of bias are identical across all values of $j$, that is, are identical for all domains in the risk of bias assessment tool.

$$
\delta_{i,1}^{\mathrm{High}} = \delta_{i,2}^{\mathrm{High}} = ... = \delta_{i,j}^{\mathrm{High}}
$$

and similarly

$$
\delta_{i,1}^{\mathrm{Moderate}} = \delta_{i,2}^{\mathrm{Moderate}} = ... = \delta_{i,j}^{\mathrm{Moderate}}
$$

```

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

<!-- TODO In the absence of any empirical data regarding the priors, I used the data from the expert elicication approach to calculate both the mean and max. These estimates, in addition to conversations with topic experts -->

For the purposes of this illustrative analysis and to highlight the generalised nature of the code used to perform the analysis (see Section \@ref(tri-software)), I defined two sets of modifying distributions (Table 1). In the first scenario, the relationship between the position assigned to each judgement is linear. In the second scenario, . In both cases, the variance of the "High" risk of bias judgement was defined to be great than the "Moderate" risk of bias judgement. The two scenarios are illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig).

Reasonable values for the position and spread of the distributions were informed by calculating the mean and maximum adjustment values as defined by the original elicitation exercise (see Appendix \@ref(?) for more details on how these were calculated). [@turner2009] <!-- TODO Link this to open data! -->

Where the direction of bias in a domain was unpredictable for a given result, the mean of the adjustment distribution for that domain, but the appropriate variance for (i.e. no predicted direction, but increased uncretainty in line with judgement).

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

####	Assessing and assigning modifying values to indirectness

A similar approach was used to define prior distributions for external bias or indirectness. I used a similar enforced scale of "Low/"Moderate"/"High" indirectness versus each of the 4 aspects of the target causal question. (recap).



In the original method, this was assessed against 4 categories of external bias (population/intervention/control/outcome)

In this 

A key example here is that 

All indirectness bias were defined as being proportional. As described i 

This is also in line with previous efforts to assess the adjustment needed due to indirectness

As crude example focusing on the intervention , versus the causal question of the effect of LDL-c in mid-life on Alzheimer's disease, studies of lipids levels in this time period would require minial adjustment, whereas studies
...

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

####	Combine in a bias-adjusted meta-analysis 

Once the total additive and proportional biases for each result were computed, they were used to define an adjusted estimate for each result included in the synthesis.

Using the method defined in Turner _et al_,[@turner2009] the adjusted estimate for each result, $\hat\theta$, is defined as:

\begin{equation}
  \hat{\theta} = \frac{y_i - \mu_{i\beta}^{\mathrm{In}}\mu_{i\delta}^{\mathrm{In}} - \mu_{i\delta}^{\mathrm{B}}}{\mu_{i\beta}^{\mathrm{B}}\mu_{i\beta}^{\mathrm{In}}}
  (\#eq:adjusted-mean)
\end{equation}

where $\mu_{i\delta}$ denotes total additive and $\mu_{i\beta}$ the total proportional adjustment, and the $^{\mathrm{B}}$ and $^{\mathrm{In}}$ superscripts denote wether the adjustment relates to internal bias or indirectness respectively.

Using the same terms, the standard error of this estimate, $\hat{\theta}$, is then calculated as:

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{SE}(\hat{\theta})=\left(\frac{1}{\mu_{i \beta}^{\mathrm{B}} \mu_{i \beta}^{\mathrm{In}}}\right)^{2}\left(s_{i}^{2}+\left(\mu_{i \beta}^{\mathrm{B}} 2+\sigma_{i \beta}^{\mathrm{B}}\right)\left(\hat{\theta}^{2} \sigma_{i \beta}^{\mathrm{In} 2}+\sigma_{i \delta}^{\mathrm{In} 2}\right)+\sigma_{i \beta}^{\mathrm{B}}\left(\hat{\theta} \mu_{i \beta}^{\mathrm{In}}+\mu_{i \delta}^{\mathrm{In}}\right)^{2}+\sigma_{i \delta}^{\mathrm{B} 2}\right)
  (\#eq:adjusted-se)
\end{equation}

Once each individual result has been adjusted, they are combined n a standard random-effects meta-analysis <!-- TODO CITATION NEEDED -->

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

#### Software {#tri-software}

Personal communication with the authors of the original method resulted in the STATA code to implement the 

As detailed in the introduction to this section, the model for defining bias-indirectness-adjusted results was available as STATA code. The  has since been generalised as part of the `triangulate` R package to allow for users to apply the approach detailed here. 

The package allows for preprocessing of domain-based risk-of-bias data to correctly identify the direction of the bias relative to the effect estimate, calculate bias/indirectness-adjusted estimates for each result, and synthesise these adjusted results in a standard random-effects meta-analysis. 

All meta-analyses conducted within the package are implemented using the `metafor` R package.

## Results

### Qualitative triangulation

```{r azd-text, echo = FALSE}
```

#### All-cause dementia

<!-- TODO Need to talk about fibrates here too -->

__Statins and all-cause dementia__

This conflicts with the findings of our analysis, where statin use was associated with an increased risk of all-cause dementia (`r anydem_text`). Some of the included studies in the meta-analysis specifically exclude vascular dementia from the definition of all-cause dementia,[@chao2015] which may limit the ability for comparison with our findings for the all-cause dementia outcome.

Additionally, a previous analysis of the THIN EHR database using a propensity-score matched analysis found a protective effect of statins on all-cause dementia (HR:0.81, 95%CI:0.69-0.96)[@smeeth2009]. 

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

#### Alzheimer's disease

__Statins and Alzheimer's disease__

Our results are broadly in line with the findings of two distinct approaches examining the effect of statin treatment on subsequent Alzheimer's disease. No randomized trials of statins for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease have been reported, but a recent meta-analysis of 20 observational studies found statins were associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60–0.80) with stronger evidence than observed in our analysis.[@poly2020] This review included case-control studies and analyses likely to be at risk of immortal time bias, which may account for the discrepancy with our findings. Additionally, a recent Mendelian randomization study examining the effect of genetic inhibition of HMGCR on Alzheimer’s disease (a genetic proxy for statin treatment) provided equivocal evidence (OR: 0.91, 95%CI: 0.63-1.31) but was consistent with our results.[@williams2020]

Our additional analyses stratified by statin properties found little evidence of differences in associations of lipophilic and hydrophilic statins and incidence of Alzheimer’s disease, consistent with a recent meta-analysis of observational studies.[@chu2018]

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

#### Vascular dementia

__Statins and vascular/other dementia__

Far fewer studies have tested the association between lipid-regulating agents and vascular dementia or other dementias. A recent review found four observational studies examining the association of statins and vascular dementia found limited evidence for an effect (RR:0.93, 95% CI 0.74–1.16).[@poly2020] This contrasts with the harmful association found in our analysis (`r vasdem_text`). When stratifying by lipid properties, lipophilic statins were more harmful than hydrophilic statins in vascular dementia, potentially due to their ability to cross the blood brain barrier.

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

__Other drug classes__

Apart from statins, few studies examining a lipid-regulating agent have been reported (Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-methods-heading)/\@ref(sys-rev-results-heading)). 

One of the few classes for which a evidence was available were fibrates, which found little evidence of an association with all-cause dementia was identified,[@ancelin2012] inconsistent with our finding that patients prescribed fibrates had higher all-cause dementia risk than those prescribed other lipid lowering agents.

A previous Mendelian randomization study found little evidence that genetic variants that proxy for ezetimibe affect risk of Alzheimer’s disease (OR: 1.17, 95%CI: 0.73-1.87),[@williams2020] consistent with our findings. Note that this study was published in 2020 and so was not included in the review.

In addition, it has sought to provide a generalised framework for quantitative triangulation, building on existing methods for systematic domain-based risk of bias assessment and bias-/indirectness-adjusted meta-analysis.

Future quantitative triangulation should move beyond the concept of comparing results at the approach level, and instead focus on the inherent threats to internal validity present in each specific result relevant to the causal question. While this makes the process both more labour intensive and complex, to assume that, for example, all retrospective studies are equally at risk is to overlook. 

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

###	Limitations and strengths

<!-- TODO See discussion of original Turner paper -->

#### Problems with quantitative triangulation approach

Missing natural variation obtained from elicitation approach. Trade-off between systematic approach presented here and personal variation obtained from several reviewers. 

A potential combination between the two would be to use the variation in risk-of-bias assessments

Elicitation and bias-adjusted not as favoured versus weighting [@stone2020] <!-- TODO Check this is actually what this reference says --> though weighting at the overall risk-of-bias level loses some of the information contained in domain-level based assessments. 

No good information on what the potential distributions for different levels of bias (High vs Moderate vs Low) should be. 

Meta-epidemiological studies on the effect of different methodological issues on results exist for randomised controlled trials,[@amer2021; @page2016] suggesting that X, Y and Z.

However, there is substantially less , arguably because of the absence of clear
Many meta-epi studies of non-randomised studies assume bias at the study-design level, similar to the early triangulation frame-work, rather than considering the actual biases deemed to be present in a given result. In this scenario, study

Potential future meta-epidemiology studies should begin to create these datasets. 

A key example of a useful future study in this domain would be the mining of maximally adjusted vs. unadjusted estimates from abstracts from primary studies to assess the impact of insufficient confounding by topic. However, these datasets could also be built from systematic reviews of a topic, as they would already be gruped by reserach domain and provided the risk of bias data is shared, provide a ready source of information

For example, if it was . New software for performing risk of bias assessments, being developed by the Bristol Appraisal and Review of Research group has this as a secondary methodological aim.


This approach has a number of advantages. One of the key ones is modifying distributions of each level of bias could be defined _a priori_ in contrast to the .

In addition, the generalised framework will allow for 


Appreciation that both the risk of bias and indirectness of a result should be assessed is growing. Indeed, some existing risk of bias for the assessment of diagnostic test accurary[@whiting2011a] and prediction models[@moons2019] consider indirectness (termed applicability in these tools) alongside the assessment of bias. <!-- TODO Cite PROBAS and QUADAS -->

#### Defining appropriate values for bias/indirectness adjustment

Much of the attention to date has been on assessing the impact of different sources of bias on effect estimates has focused predominantly on randomised controlled trials. 

For example, a study examining the effect of found that only a subset of domains appear to impact the result, and that this effect is modest (10% change).[@savovic2018] However, this work examined RCTs, and these findings may not hold for other non-randomised study designs. <!-- TODO Double check this citation actually says what you think it does! -->

A further issue is the "Low" risk of bias domain. In this proof-of-concept analysis, I assumed that domains at "Low" risk of bias did not require any adjustment. However, "Low" risk of bias is not equivalent to the absence of bias, and potentially should still be adjusted for. In this case, defining the predicted direction of bias would be challenging in the absence of obvious sources of bias (particularly given how challenging it can be when sources of bias are evident within a domain). 

In previous attempts at bias/indirectness-adjusted meta-analysis, the extent to each was assessed via a elicitation process using a number of experts. This approach is potentially subject to misclassification of the impact of bias on the basis of the results, as there is no way to ensure that results at a similar level of bias for confounding (for example) are being adjusted by the same amount. For example, if experts are influenced by the absolute effect estimate, then a result demonstrating a stronger protective effect may receive greater modification than a study at the same "risk" of confounding but with a more modest effect. This is particular true where experts have preconceived ideas about the true effectiveness of the intervention.

In this case, separating the assessment of bias from the assignment of modifying values to each level of bias will limit the potential for. Alternatively, reasonable modifying distributions for each level of bias could be defined _a priori_ by the study team, similar to how important confounders and co-interventions are defined in advance when performing ROBINS-I/ROBINS-E assessments.

In the mean time, the extent of the impact of knowledge of the results could be analysed using existing data. For example, a re-analysis of the data presented in a recent paper where both expert eliciation and structured

The graphics shown in Section \@ref() do not show the type of bias (additive or proportional), only the direction. While this is acceptable, future work could assess, potentially by using different arrow types to denote the different types of bias.

### Need for new method

As the need and appetite for synthesis of different, future iterations of the risk of bias tools should take this into account. Simple steps like harmonising the risk of bias levels across tools would be a good first move towards a more integrate suite of tools. Similarly, software that implements the risk-of-bias tools should both allow for direction of bias question and carefully consider how this data will be exported.

Can I suggest any empirical studies that need to be performed? Average strength of immortal time bias/etc?

While the limitations inherent to this method are important, and limit the , they reflect a more detailed appreciation of the complexities of risk of bias assessment and triangulation as whole (i.e. not applying expected directions of effects to an entire category of studies ). 

This approach also builds on existing approaches employed previously by "exploding out" the results of a systematic review/meta-analysis and considering the effects of bias in each individual result separately. This more granular approach is to be preferred over assigning a bias judgement and direction to the summary effect produced by a meta-analysis,  which may mask the different biases applicable to each unique result.

### Filling in the gaps

Triangulation, both qualitative and quantitative, should be considered an extension of evidence synthesis, and so. Triangulation exercises should be based on comprehensive systematic reviews to create. If needed, evidence gaps can be addressed through additional studies, as in the case of this analysis,

## Conclusion

Triangulation is a promising developing field, somewhat hamstrung by the limited understanding of the impact of biases at the meta-epidemiological level.

In this chapter, I have presented a new method of visualising both the level and expected direction of bias inherent to each result, and suggested how this could be incorporated with a bias-adjusted meta-analysis approach to work towards a generalised quantitative triangulation framework. 

Finally, I've highlighted the limitations of this method, as the correct distributions of modifying values in each risk-of-bias domain should be driven by meta-epidemiological studies which do not yet exist, framing them as opportunities for future research.

This chapter has demonstrated a repurposed framework for quantitative triangulation, exploiting existing methods in evidence synthesis and developments in the assessment of different risks of bias. 

It also introduce a new way to visualise the biases at work in a particular result, rather than making assumptions about the type and directions of bias at the study design level as suggested by previous work on this topic. 

Finally, it highlighted the limitations of current methods for triangulation in the absence of informative priors for the impact of biases across the 

The implications of this work to clinical practice, public health and future research is considered in the following chapter.
