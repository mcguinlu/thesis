# Individual participant data meta-analysis {#ipd-heading}
\minitoc <!-- this will include a mini table of contents-->

## Data sources

As part of this Chapter, I will use individual patient data from a range of sources. These sources are described here in detail for reference.

Should also include a list of reasons why specific additional cohorts were not included - some like the EHR might be too big to get

Each should have: 

* Description (including observation period, numbers, numbers with outcome, etc)
*
*

```{r tests, }

```


Different approaches to combining subgroups. [@fisher2017]
