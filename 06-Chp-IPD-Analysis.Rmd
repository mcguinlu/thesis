## Data sources

As part of this Chapter, I will use individual patient data from a range of sources. These sources are described here in detail for reference.

Should also include a list of reasons why specific additional cohorts were not included - some like the EHR might be too big to get

Each should have: 

* Description (including period,numbers, numbers with outcome, etc)
*
*

```{r tests, }

```
