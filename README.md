The pdf file must be named â€˜PGR_submission_student surname_student first name_student number'. You may use the Facility for the Upload of Large Files (fluff), if your dissertation forms a large file. Please contact pgr-exams@bristol.ac.uk if you have any queries on this submission, including if your dissertation incorporates physical material, such as creative works.
1. Turnitin check. You must upload an electronic copy of your dissertation to Turnitin via Blackboard so that the pre-examination academic integrity and plagiarism check can be completed. You must also send an email to the relevant e-submission mailbox specified on Blackboard to notify your School that you have uploaded to Turnitin. Please contact your School PGR administrator if you need help with uploading to Turnitin.
