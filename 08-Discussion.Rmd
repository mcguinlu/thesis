## Introduction 

The aim of this thesis was to attempt to infer the causal effect of blood lipid levels on dementia outcomes. In this discussion, I will review the role of each chapter in the broader thesis, summarise the principal findings and contributions of this thesis, and discuss the implications of my findings for both clinical and public health policy. I consider the overall strengths and limitations of this thesis as a coherent body of work, and suggest avenues for impactful future research based on my findings and experiences.

&nbsp;

### Chapter summary

This thesis is comprised of a mix of methodological and applied chapters.

In Chapter __Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-tools-heading)__, I introduced the core concepts considered in this thesis and presented the research performed in terms fo the theoretical framework of evidence synthesis.

In __Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-tools-heading)__, I  presented a new tool for the systematic searching of health-related preprints, and detailed two use cases for preprint metadata beyond the systematic searching of this evidence source.

In __Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-methods-heading)__, I describe the methods of a comprehensive systematic review of the relationship between dementia outcomes and blood lipids (and treatments that modify them). The results of this analysis are then presented in __Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-results-heading)__.

In __Chapter \@ref(cprd-heading)__, I describe an analysis of the association of lipid-regulating agent use and dementia outcomes in the CPRD, a large electronic health record database. I make use of control outcomes to illustrate insufficiently controlled confounding.

In __Chapter \@ref(ipd-heading)__, I present an individual patient data meta-analysis of the association of lipid levels and dementia outcomes, using previously unanalysed data accessed via the Dementia Platform UK.

Finally, in __Chapter \@ref(tri-heading)__ I propose a new method for the systematic integration of multiple evidence sources as part of quantitative triangulation framework. I illustrate the method using two case studies (the effect of LDL-c on Alzheimer's disease and the effect of triglycerides on vascular dementia), drawing on the evidence identified or produced by previous chapters.

A particular lesson is the better scoping of future work. In hindsight, the decision to take a broad approach to inclusion of dementia outcomes resulted in larger workload than anticipated, particularly when considering evidence from across different study designs. Given the opportunity to redesign the review, I would have chosen to focus on a specific dementia outcome.

Similarly, the decision to attempt to undertake a individual patient data analysis was

### Reproducible research

Reproducible and science has been a key theme running through this thesis, as reflected by the development of an open source tool to help search medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint metadata. In line with this, an open source copy of the code used to produce this thesis is available on GitHub, as is the code used to perform the analysis contained within it. 

Unfortunately, given the. However, as discussed in other chapters of this thesis and elsewhere, sharing of analysis code is a useful step towards transparency when the underlying datasets are not readily available.

Commentary on the fact that the best you can do is replicate vs reproducible (due the closed nature of the data).

One is the ability to recreate the results given the same data and code, the other is the ability to recreate the results given the same code but a different dataset. IN theory it is possible to gain access the dataset given the information presented in Chapter \@(ref:cprd-analysis-heading). However, access is dependency on an ISAC application to the managing body of the CPRD.

## Summary of clinical findings

### Effect of blood lipids on dementia outcomes

Overall, I did not identify a consistent effect of any blood lipid fraction (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides) on any dementia outcome (all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia). 

While published non-randomised studies provided evidence for a protective effect of statin use on Alzheimer's disease, this effect was not maintained when incorporated along with other sources of evidence in a quantitative triangulation framework. However, this equally may indicate that statins have a pleiotropic effects on Alzheimer's disease, that is an effect other than through lipid-lowering. However, this observed effect could also be due to reporting biases, a 

Statins were by far the most studied lipid-regulating agent in relation to dementia outcomes, a unsurprising finding given the large proportion of patients taking statins as indicated by my analysis of the CPRD data.

### Comparison with new evidence

Since the searches underpinning the systematic review described in this thesis were performed (July 2019), there have been some notable analysis of large cohorts performed related to the central thesis question here. Two of these are discussed here notable studies are discussed here.

The first is a large scale analysis of blood lipids in the CPRD, which found a slight raised risk of dementia in CPRD patients () with higher LDL-c measured at mid-life, driven by the finding for Alzheimer's disease.[@iwagami2021] These findings are consistent with the findings presented in this thesis, particularly given the lack of adjustment for confounding by ApoE4. The study performed a simulation study to investigate the expected effect of confounding by _ApoE4_ in the absence of a true causal effect, yeilding a RR of 1.09 per 1-SD increase in LDL-c.

The second analysis examined 502,226 participants in the UK Biobank, a large population-based prospective cohort study.[@gong2021; @sudlow2015] The analysis found no association between lipids measured at mid-life and dementia outcomes (women: TC `r estimate(1.04,.99,1.09,"HR")`, HDL `r estimate(0.95,.83,1.1,"HR")`, LDL `r estimate(1.06,1,1.13,"HR")`/ men: TC `r estimate(0.98,.93,1.03,"HR")`, HDL `r estimate(1.1,.95,1.29,"HR")`, LDL `r estimate(.97,.91,1.04,"HR")`). The results were broadly similar between the all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia outcomes, and are comparable to the results of this thesis. However, similar to the study discussed above, this analysis did not have access to genetic data and so may be subject to residual confounding by _ApoE4_ genotype.

### Implications for clinical practice

The clinical recommendations that can be drawn from the work in this thesis are limited, due to the low strength of evidence. Across multiple sources of evidence, there was no consistent effect of blood lipids on dementia outcomes. In addition, a lack of precision makes 

This should focus on doctors being honest with patients from the outset and describing what they know regarding the uncertainty of the evidence.


Clinicians should convey the uncertainty of evidence

While also recognising that the impact of statin or other LRA use on dementia is going to be secondary to their established effect on lipid-lowering. To even be at risk of developing dementia, patients must survive to old-age, something that is substantially less likely given uncontolled hypercholesterolaemia.

However, even under the scenario that a strong protective effect was identified, whether or not to prescribed a statin at mid-life will always be guided by factors other than dementia prevention. Patients must live to a certain age in order to be at risk of dementia (with the exception of familial early onset dementias), which is substantially less likely if hypercholesterolemia is left unchecked.

However, while this thesis did not provide any evidence for a protective effect of lipid-lowering, it similarly did not provide any evidence for a harmful effect of statin exposure on dementia outcomes. 

There was very we. Conversely however, there was an absence of evidence for a harmful effect of statins on. Given the reality that given the choice, given the conflicting evidence 

As with many many studies of dementia outcomes, a key limiting factor of any analysis is the absence of a detailed pathological mechanism for the condition. It could well be that statins do have a true effect independently of lipid levels, though based on the certainty of evidence in NRSI, this is unlikely.

## Overall strengths and limitations

The strengths a limitations of each component of this thesis have been discussed in the respective chapters. Here I highlight the strengths and weaknesses of this thesis as a body of work.

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

### Strengths

There are several strengths to this thesis as a whole. The use of a systematic review incorporating multiple study designs and preprinted literature provided a strong and comprehensive evidence base with which to assess my research question.

This thesis has also produce new evidence on the association of blood lipids on dementia outcomes via two primary analysis. Specifically, it has provided additional information on a previously understudied association (lipids/LRA and vascular dementia).

A focus on bias has been a central aspect of this thesis. In the systematic review, detailed risk of bias assessments were used to assess the bias, while in the CPRD analysis, controls outcomes were used to provide evidence for uncontrolled bias due to confounding. Finally, the triangulation framework presented in Chapter \@ref(hold) seeks to adjust for the bias in each resul.

A final strength of this thesis is the production of software to support the novel evidence synthesis techniques used.

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

\newpage

### Weaknessess

However, there are several strong limitations to this thesis. 

Each analysis presented makes use of secondary data sources, be it published literature, electronic health records, or existing cohorts. Secondary data can limit the type of analyses performed (for example, in the IPD analysis presented in, absence of time-to-event data prevented the use of hazard ratios to quantify dementia risk) and the validity of the data, if collected for purposes other than research (for example, the accuracy of dementia diagnoses in electronic health records can be poor[@wilkinson2018]).

Further, missing evidence was a common limitation across this thesis. In Chapters \@ref(hold)/\@ref(hold), several studies stated that they did not report the results of an analysis because the results were not significant. This was particularly common among non-randomised studies of exposure examining blood lipids directly. Similarly, an absence of evidence on vascular dementia, potentially due to a publication bias mechanism, limited the analysis of this outcome. Finally, missing evidence also presented as an issue in the form of a poor response to data access requests was also observed in the IPD analysis reported in Chapter \@ref(hold).

A final weakness of this thesis is the geographical focus. All primary analysis presented drew on data from the UK (CPRD, CaPS, EPIC Norfolk, Whitehall II), while the majority of studies identified by the review were based in the Western world. This may limit the generalisability of the results presented to different populations. 

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

\newpage

## Future work

Several avenues of future research, building on the work presented here, could be pursued.

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

### Inclusion of preprints

<!-- TODO Incorporate Julian's comments below -->

<!-- REVIEW [JH] I think, on general reflection, that portraying this as an issue around “grey literature” may not be particularly useful. Preprints are arguably some of the least “grey” of the very ambiguously defined family of grey sources, such that some definitions of “grey” might not include them.
It seems to me that preprints are such a big and important part of the landscape now that you can just portray the methodology as dealing with preprints rather than including grey literature.
Interesting debate as to whether preprints are grey literature, given that many of them are increasingly becoming findable in electronic bibliographic databases. We have no clear and widely used definition of grey literature.  -->

Given the evidence that this thesis produced on the usefulness of including preprints, normalisation of inclusion of preprints in systematic reviews. Wider assessment of the evidence base that exists solely as preprinted literature ()

Meta-epidemiological studies examining the factors which influence eventual publication would also help to quantify the extent and strength of publication bias


Preprints also represent a key opportunity to assess the impact of peer review and editorial guidelines on manuscripts, by enabling a comparison of the same paper at two stages (preprinted versus published). This fact was used to explore the impact of editorial polices on open data sharing, as discussed in Chapter \@ref(), but could be used to other important meta-research questions.

Future work should also address how to handle discrepancies between the preprinted and published versions of a paper when identifying results for inclusion in an evidence synthesis exercise. This will be particularly important if the results are substantially different between the two versions or if a result availble in the preprint manuscript is not presented in the published version.

Finally, the availability of the `medrxivr` tool enables programmatic searching of health-related preprints, and future work could incorporate the tool into an automated searching pipeline as part of a living systematic review.

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  
\newpage

### Evidence on vascular dementia

As discussed in an earlier section, there is an absence of evidence on vascular dementia across the evidence base

Future work should aim to both investigate the reasons for this evidence gap and work to address it. In particular, large-scale GWAS of vascular dementia should be performed, to identify associated loci that future two-sample Mendelian randomisation studies could make use of. While this is methodologically challenging, given the difficult in diagnosing "pure" vascular dementia, it would be a worthwhile endeavour, allowing for the assessment of many genetically-driven risk factors beyond those considered in this thesis.

This is particularly relevant given that there was some evidence for an association of hypertriglyceraemia with vascular dementia. Future research should explicitly examine this relationship as part of wider exploration of vascular disease.

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  
\newpage

### Reviewing Mendelian randomisation studies

As noted in previous chapters, evidence synthesis theory and methods have not been sufficient developed for the inclusion of Mendelian randomisation studies.

A key issue arises from the lack of an established risk of bias tool, limiting future work that requires systematic risk-of-bias assessment, such as the triangulation framework presented in Chapter \@ref(hold). In addition, a lack of guidance around whether the inclusion of two-sample Mendelian randomisation studies using identical summary statistics. This was illustrated in detail in Chapter \@ref(4), where XXX studies using the same , and meta-analysing these as independent effect estimates would provide an overly precise result. Finally, future work should aim to validate search strategies for this study design, paying particular attention to the range of terms used to define it (e.g. genetic instrumental variable analysis).

Synthesis of Mendelian randomisation studies is not helped by the varied (and often poor) reporting, though the recent release of the STROBE-MR reporting guidelines should go someway to addressing this. 

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  
\newpage

### Triangulation

It is customary at this point to recommend that a large scale randomised controlled trials be designed to run to assess the effect of the intervention. Given the logistical challenges of trials for outcomes with long prodomal periods such as dementia, is the post-trial follow-up of existing RCTs of lipid-regulating agents. Examples of this approach for long term (11-20 years) assessment of safety outcomes associated with statin use, using patient recontact and linkage with electronic health records.[@ford2016; @group2011] A similar approach could be used to assess the impact of randomisation to statins in these trials on dementia outcomes. 

However, in general there is a need to better make use of non-randomised evidence, particularly in areas where RCTs are not easily performed. As such, quantitative triangulation is an  one ripe for future work. 

Future work would account for methods for adjustment of meta-biases, such as those introduced by

These domains specific distritions should

Finally, substantial future work should be directed towards the conduct of meta-epidemiological studies to assess the impact of different bias in non-observational studies. While frameworks such as the one employed in Chapter \@ref(tri-heading) exist to allow for the production of bias-adjusted and triangulated estimates.

Finally, accounting for bias (and indirectness, if considering causal effects rather than a summary of the literature) is essentially in the interpretation of published literature. While this can take many forms, from the stratification of forest plots by overall risk of bias level, to the or to the more advanced bias adjustment approach detailed here, it is insufficient to draw clinical recommendations from meta-analysis that treat effect estimates as if they were unbiased.

## Overall conclusions

This thesis provides new evidence concerning the role of blood lipids as a modifiable risk factor for dementia and highlights the uncertainty that still remains in relation to this causal question. In addition, it has developed new evidence synthesis methods and tools, specifically around the inclusion of preprints in systematic reviews and the quantitative triangulation of evidence sources.
