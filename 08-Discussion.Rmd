## Introduction 

The aim of this thesis was to attempt to infer the causal effect of blood lipid levels on dementia outcomes.

In this chapter I will summarise the principal findings from my thesis, assess the unique contributions of this thesis to the field of research, discuss the implications for both clinical and public health policy, describe the overall strengths and limitations of this thesis as a whole, suggest avenues for impactful future research based on my findings and experiences.

In __Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-tools-heading)__ presents a new tool for the systematic searching of health-related preprints, and detail

In __Chapters \@ref(sys-rev-methods-heading) & \@ref(sys-rev-results-heading)__ describe the methods and results of a comprehensive systematic review of the relationship between blood lipids (and treatments that modify them) and dementia outcomes.

In __Chapter \@ref(cprd-heading)__ presents an analysis of lipid-regulating use and dementia outcomes in the CPRD, a large scale 

In __Chapter \@ref(ipd-heading)__ presents an individual patient data meta-analysis, using previously unanalysed data accessed via the Dementia Platform UK.

In __Chapter \@ref(tri-heading)__ presents a narrative summary of the evidence identified and produced by the preceding chapters, and proposes a new method of systematically integration of multiple evidence sources as part of quantitative triangulation exercise.

## New evidence produced

Since the systematic review was performed, there have been some notable further analysis related to the central thesis question here. Two of these are discussed here notable studies are discussed here.

Found slight raised risk of dementia in CPRD patients () with higher LDL-c measured at mid-life, driven by the finding for Alzheimer's disease [@iwagami2021]. Not inconsistent with the findings presented in this thesis, particularly given the lack of adjustment for confounding by ApoE4.

<!-- TODO The study says that simulated effect of ApoE4 is a 1.09 RR in the absence of a true causal effect. Main results are between 1.03 and 1.17. CI for most extreme results is (lower = 1.08) is not inconsistent with the effect introduced by ApoE4 which is just a single confounder out of many -->

In relation to the suggestion in this analysis that raised triglycerides were associated with an increasede risk of vascular dementia, a 2021 study in a  125,727 Danish participants found the moderate hypertriglyceridemia was associated with increased risk of non-Alzheimer's dementia (`r estimate(1.79, 1.16,2.87,"HR")`).[@nordestgaard2021]

## Lessons learned

As part 

In hindsight, the decision to take a broad approach to inclusion of dementia outcomes potentially resulted in larger workload than anticipated, particularly when considered evidence from across different study designs. In a do-over, I would have considered a single dementia outcome.

Additionally, in hindsight, I may have considered a mor. However, under the conditions of my grant, the scope for chang

As a reflective process throughout the PhD, I maintained a catalogue of failures (available in Appendix \@ref(appendix-catalogue-failures)).

## Overall strengths and limitations

The strengths a limitations of each component of this thesis are discussed in the respective chapters. Here I highlight the strengths and weakness of the thesis as a body of work.

This thesis has used multiple sources of evidence to examine the relationship between blood lipids levels and cholesterol risk. 

It has highlighted the importance of including preprints in systematic review, and provided a tool to enable researchers to easily do so. 

It has analysed two previously unanalysed datasets, adding useful information to the evidence base.

However, the thesis as a whole is subject to some strong limitations. 


__Strengths__
- New evidence sources for an under-studied condition
- Development of new methods and tool




__Weaknesses__
A general limitation of this thesis is the absence of known results/data. This occured in both the systematic review, via the selection of reporting results and potential for publication bias. It was also observeed. 

These facts both potentially bias the summary associations observed here, in addition to weakening the precision of the estimates produced. 

- Confounding by indication

- A lot of UK based data




There are several strengths and limitations to the work presented in this thesis. One particularly strength is the lengths gone to find all available published and unpublished evidence around the question, and to integrate this evidence in a coherent framework, taking into account the limitations of ach source and how these limitations may be used to provide

## Implications of this research

### Clinical practice

Across multiple sources of evidence, there was no consistent effect of blood lipids, or . Some 

The clinical recommendations that can be drawn from the work in this thesis are limited, due to the low strength of evidence related to the

There was very we. Conversely however, there was an absence of evidence for a harmful effect of statins on. Given the reality that given the choice, given the conflicting evidence 

Patients must live to a sufficient age to be at risk of dementia outcomes, which is substantially less like if high lipid levels in mid-life. 

The role of lipid-lowering 

As with many many studies of dementia outcomes, a key limiting factor of any analysis is the absence of a detailed pathological mechanism for Alzheimer's disease. It could well be that statins do have a true effect independently of lipid levels, though based on the certainty of evidence in NRSI, this is unlikely.

However, based on the available evidence

## Reproducible research

Reproducible and science has been a key theme running through this thesis, as reflected by the development of an open source tool to help search medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint metadata. In line with this, an open source copy of the code used to produce this thesis is available on GitHub, as is the code used to perform the analysis contained within it. 

<!-- TODO Could he get it work, could he feck. -->

Unfortunately, given the. However, as discussed in other chapters of this thesis and elsewhere, sharing of analysis code is a useful step towards transparency when the underlying datasets are not readily available.

Commentary on the fact that the best you can do is replicate vs reproducible (due the closed nature of the data).

One is the ability to recreate the results given the same data and code, the other is the ability to recreate the results given the same code but a different dataset. IN theory it is possible to gain access the dataset given the information presented in Chapter \@(ref:cprd-analysis-heading). However, access is dependency on an ISAC application to the managing body of the CPRD.

## Future work

Several avenues for future research, building on the work presented here, are possible.

### Inclusion of preprints

Normalisation of inclusion of preprints in systematic reviews. Wider assessment of the evidence base that exists solely as preprinted literature ()

Studying of factors which influence eventual publication would also help to identify the extent and strength of publication bias by providing a 

Preprints also represent a key opportunity to assess the impact of peer review on qualitative changes within

### Evidence on vascular dementia

As discussed, there is an absence of evidence on vascular dementia across the evidence base, potentially driven (for NRSI) at the leasby a publication

large-scale GWAS of vascular dementia should be performed, to identify associated loci that future Mendelian randomisation studies can make use of. While this is methodologically challenging, given the difficult in diagnosing "pure" vascular dementia, it would be a worthwhile endeavour, and would allow for the assessment of many genetically driven risk factors beyond those considered in this thesis.

This is particularly relevant given that there was some evidence for an association of hypertriglyceraecia with vascular dementia. Future research should explicitly examine this relationship as part o f wider exploration of vascular disease.

 <!-- TODO See notes from Pat/Emma on this -->

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

### Viewing of Mendelian randomisation studies

As noted in Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-heading-results), evidence synthesis theory and methods have not been sufficient developed for the inclusion of Mendelian randomisation studies.

A key issue arises from the lack of an established risk of bias tool, which adds uncertainty to the accuracy of risk-of-bias assessments which can influence future work based on them, as discussed in Chapter \@ref(7). In addition, a lack of guidance around whether the inclusion of two-sample Mendelian randomisation studies using identical summary statistics. This was illustrated in detail in Chapter \@ref(4), where XXX studies using the same , and meta-analysing these as independent effect estimates would provide an overly precise result. Finally, future work should aim to validate search strategies for this study design, paying particular attention to the range of terms used to define it (e.g. genetic instrumental variable analysis).

Synthesis of Mendelian randomisation studies is not helped by the varied (and often poor) reporting, though the recent release of the STROBE-MR reporting guidelines should go someway to addressing this. 

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

### Empirical estimates of bias

Finally, substantial future work should be directed towards the conduct of meta-epidemiological studies to assess the impact of different bias in non-observational studies. While frameworks such as the one employed in Chapter \@ref(tri-heading) exist to allow for the production of bias-adjusted and triangulated estimates.
