# Discussion {#discussion-heading}
\minitoc <!-- this will include a mini table of contents-->

<!-- ## Additional topics for the discussion -->

<!-- There are several addition topics I would like to cover: -->

<!-- * The difference between the peer review of the software vs. the peer review of papers. A conversation until everything is fixed/clear reporting guidelines/checklists, with acceptance dependent on them being implemented /built-in version control, and cross linking discussion points to changes through the linking of commits and comments.  Essentially, a more transparent and open -->

### Strengths and Limitations

There are several strengths and limitations to the work presented in this thesis. One particularly strength is the lengths gone to find all available published and unpublished evidence around the question, and to integrate this evidence in a coherent framework, taking into account the limitations of ach source and how these limitations may be used to provide

## Reproducible research

Reproducible and science has been a key theme running through this thesis, as reflected by the development of an open source tool to help search medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint metadata. In line with this, an open source copy of the code used to produce this thesis is available on GitHub, as is the code used to perform the analysis contained within it. 

Containerisation was used to ensure that the code is reproducible, in line iwht best practices

Commentary on the fact that the best you can do is replicate vs reproducible (due the closed nature of the data).

One is the ability to recreate the results given the same data and code, the other is the ability to recreate the results given the same code but a different dataset. IN theory it is possible to gain access the dataset given the information presented in Chapter \@(ref:cprd-analysis-heading). However, access is dependency on an ISAC application to the managing body of the CPRD.

## Public involvement and engagement {#disc-PPI}

<!-- TODO May need to tone this down a little bit -->


Involving and engaging the public and patients has been a central theme to this thesis. 
Public engagement activities included 

Public involvement also steered the creation of the topic

## Future work

Normalisation of inclusion of preprints in systematic reviews. Wider assessment of the evidence base that exists solely as preprinted literature ()

Secondly, large-scale GWAS of vascular dementia should be performed, to identify associated loci that future Mendelian randomisation studies can make use of. While this is methodologically challenging, given the difficult in diagnosing "pure" vascular dementia, it would be a worthwhile endeavour, and would allow for the assessment of many genetically driven risk factors beyond those considered in this thesis.

 <!-- TODO See notes from Pat/Emma on this -->

As a field, and as noted in Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-heading-results), the evidence synthesis theory and methods have not been sufficient developed for Mendelian randomisation studies. Future work should aim to validate search strategies for this study design, paying particular attention to the range of terms used to define it (e.g. genetic instrumental variable analysis.)

Finally, substantial future work should be directed towards the conduct of meta-epidemiologocial studies to assess the impact of different bias in non-pbservational studies. While frameworks such as the one employed in Chapter \@ref(tri-heading) exist to allow for the production of bias-adjusted and triangulated estimates.
