### Strengths and Limitations

There are several strengths and limitations to the work presented in this thesis. One particularly strength is the lengths gone to find all available published and unpublished evidence around the question, and to integrate this evidence in a coherent framework, taking into account the limitations of ach source and how these limitations may be used to provide 

Need for large simple trials for common disease where small treatment effect can have large effect - [@yusuf1984]

## Reproducible research

Reproducible and science has been a key theme running through this thesis, as reflected by the development of an open source tool to help search medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint metadata. In line with this, an open source copy of the code used to produce this thesis is available on GitHub, as is the code used to perform the analysis contained within it. 

Containerisation was used to ensure that the code is reproducible, in line iwht best practices

Commentary on the fact that the best you can do is replicate vs reproducible (due the closed nature of the data).

One is the ability to recreate the results given the same data and code, the other is the ability to recreate the results given the same code but a different dataset. IN theory it is possible to gain access the dataset given the information presented in Chapter \@(ref:cprd-analysis-heading). However, access is dependency on an ISAC application to the managing body of the CPRD.

## Public involvement and engagement {#disc-PPI}

Involving and engaging the public and patients has been a central theme to this thesis. 

Public engagement activities included 

Public involvement also steered the creation of the topic

## Future work

Recommend future large scale GWAS of other dementia outcomes, notably vascular dementia, or the use of existing GWAS to  <!-- TODO At least one vascular dementia GWAS exists - find it and cite it here. -->
