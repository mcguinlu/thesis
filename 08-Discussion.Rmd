## Introduction 

The aim of this thesis was to attempt to infer the causal effect of blood lipid levels on dementia outcomes. In this discussion, I will review the role of each chapter in the broader thesis, summarise the principal findings and contributions of this thesis, and discuss the implications of my findings for both clinical and public health policy. I consider the overall strengths and limitations of this thesis as a coherent body of work, and suggest avenues for impactful future research based on my findings and experiences.

### Chapter summary

This thesis is comprised of a mix of informative, methodological and applied chapters.

In Chapter __Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-tools-heading)__, I introduced the core concepts considered in thie

In __Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-tools-heading)__, I  presented a new tool for the systematic searching of health-related preprints, and detail

In __Chapters \@ref(sys-rev-methods-heading)__, I describe the methods of a comprehensive systematic review of the relationship between dementia outcomes and blood lipids (and treatments that modify them). The results of this analysis are then presented in __Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-results-heading)__.

In __Chapter \@ref(cprd-heading)__, I describe an analysis of lipid-regulating use and dementia outcomes in the CPRD, a large scale electronic health database. I make use of control outcomes to illustrate insufficiently controlled biases

In __Chapter \@ref(ipd-heading)__, I present an individual patient data meta-analysis, using previously unanalysed data accessed via the Dementia Platform UK to add to the evidence base on the association of blood lipids and dementia outcomes.

Finally, in __Chapter \@ref(tri-heading)__ I propose a new method of systematically integration of multiple evidence sources as part of quantitative triangulation exercise. I illustrate the method by considering two causal questions (LDL-c and Alzheimer's disease; triglycerides and vascular dementia), drawing on the evidence identified or produced by previous chapters.

In hindsight, the decision to take a broad approach to inclusion of dementia outcomes potentially resulted in larger workload than anticipated, particularly when considered evidence from across different study designs. In a do-over, I would have considered a single dementia outcome.

Additionally, in hindsight, I may have considered a more methodological thesis. The Chapter's I enjoyed working on the most (Chapters \@ref())

### Reproducible research

Reproducible and science has been a key theme running through this thesis, as reflected by the development of an open source tool to help search medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint metadata. In line with this, an open source copy of the code used to produce this thesis is available on GitHub, as is the code used to perform the analysis contained within it. 

Unfortunately, given the. However, as discussed in other chapters of this thesis and elsewhere, sharing of analysis code is a useful step towards transparency when the underlying datasets are not readily available.

Commentary on the fact that the best you can do is replicate vs reproducible (due the closed nature of the data).

One is the ability to recreate the results given the same data and code, the other is the ability to recreate the results given the same code but a different dataset. IN theory it is possible to gain access the dataset given the information presented in Chapter \@(ref:cprd-analysis-heading). However, access is dependency on an ISAC application to the managing body of the CPRD.

## Summary of clinical findings

### Effect of blood lipids on dementia outcomes

Overall, I did not identify a consistent effect of any blood lipid fraction (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol or triglycerides) on any dementia outcome (all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia). 
While published non-randomised studies provided evidence for a protective effect of statin use on Alzheimer's disease, this effect was not maintained when incorporated along with other sources of evidence in a quantitative triangulation framework. However, this equally may indicate that statins have a pleiotropic effects on Alzheimer's disease, that is an effect other than through lipid-lowering. However, this observed effect could also be due to reporting biases, a

Statins were by far the most studied lipid-regulating agent in relation to dementia outcomes, a unsurprising finding given the large proportion of patients taking statins as indicated by my analysis of the CPRD data.

### Comparison with new evidence

Since the systematic review described in this thesis was performed, there have been two notable analysis of large cohorts performed related to the central thesis question here. Two of these are discussed here notable studies are discussed here.

The first a large scale analysis of blood lipids in the CPRD, which found a slight raised risk of dementia in CPRD patients () with higher LDL-c measured at mid-life, driven by the finding for Alzheimer's disease.[@iwagami2021] These findings are  consistent with the findings presented in this thesis, particularly given the lack of adjustment for confounding by ApoE4. <!-- TODO The study says that simulated effect of _ApoE4_ is a 1.09 RR in the absence of a true causal effect. Main results are between 1.03 and 1.17. CI for most extreme results is (lower = 1.08) is not inconsistent with the effect introduced by _ApoE4_ which is just a single confounder out of many -->

The UKBioBank is a [@sudlow2015]
 
A recent analysis of 502,226 participants of this found no association between lipids at mid-life and dementia outcomes (women: TC `r estimate(1.04,.99,1.09,"HR")`, HDL `r estimate(0.95,.83,1.1,"HR")`, LDL `r estimate(1.06,1,1.13,"HR")`/men: TC `r estimate(0.98,.93,1.03,"HR")`, HDL `r estimate(1.1,.95,1.29,"HR")`, LDL `r estimate(.97,.91,1.04,"HR")`).[@gong2021] Results were boardly similar between the all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia outcomes. This is comparable to my findings.

### Implications for clinical practice

This should focus on doctors being honesty with patients from the outset and describing what they know regarding the uncertainty of the evidence.

While also recognising that the impact of statin or other LRA use on dementia is going to be secondary to their established effect on lipid-lowering. To even be at risk of developing dementia, patients must survive to old-age, something that is substantially less likely given uncontolled hypercholesterolaemia.


The clinical recommendations that can be drawn from the work in this thesis are limited, due to the low strength of evidence. Across multiple sources of evidence, there was no consistent effect of blood lipids on dementia outcomes.

However, even under the scenario that a strong protective effect was identified, whether or not to prescribed a statin at mid-life will always be guided by factors other than dementia prevention. Patients must live to a certain age in order to be at risk of dementia (with the exception of familial early onset dementias), which is substantially less likely if hypercholesterolemia is left unchecked.

However, while this thesis did not provide any evidence for a protective effect of lipid-lowering, it similarly did not provide any evidence for a harmful effect of statin exposure on dementia outcomes. 

There was very we. Conversely however, there was an absence of evidence for a harmful effect of statins on. Given the reality that given the choice, given the conflicting evidence 

As with many many studies of dementia outcomes, a key limiting factor of any analysis is the absence of a detailed pathological mechanism for the condition. It could well be that statins do have a true effect independently of lipid levels, though based on the certainty of evidence in NRSI, this is unlikely.

## Overall strengths and limitations

The strengths a limitations of each component of this thesis have been discussed in the respective chapters. Here I highlight the strengths and weakness of the thesis as a body of work.

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

### Strengths

This thesis has used multiple sources of evidence to examine the relationship between blood lipids levels and cholesterol risk in a systematic manner, including diverse sources of evidence, inclu

It has highlighted the importance of including preprints in systematic review, and provided a tool to enable researchers to easily do so. 

It has provided new evidence on an understudied condition (vascular demenita), analysing three previously unexplored datasets to provide evinde

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

\newpage

### Weaknessess

However, the thesis as a whole is subject to some strong limitations. 

A general limitation of this thesis is the absence of known results/data. This occurred in both the systematic review, via the selection of reporting results and potential for publication bias. It was also observed. 

Similarly, missing evidence was a common theme across this thesis. In Chapters \@ref(hold)/\@ref(hold), several studies stated that they did not report the results of an analysis because the results were not significant. This was particularly common among non-randomised studies of exposure examining blood lipids directly. Fortunately, new tools such as the forthcoming ROB-ME. 

Similarly, an absence of evidence on vascular dementia limits the certainty. In both these cases, accounting for missing evidence will be an important part of future evidence snythesis work on this topic.  

Missing evidence in the form of a poor response to data access requests was also observed in the IPD analysis reported in Chapter \@ref(hold).

A final weakness of this thesis is the geographical focus. All primary analysis presented drew on data from the UK population (CPRD, CaPS, EPIC Norfolk, Whitehall II). 

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

\newpage

## Future work

Several avenues for future research, building on the work presented here, are possible.

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

### Inclusion of preprints

<!-- TODO Incorporate Julian's comments below -->

<!-- REVIEW [JH] I think, on general reflection, that portraying this as an issue around “grey literature” may not be particularly useful. Preprints are arguably some of the least “grey” of the very ambiguously defined family of grey sources, such that some definitions of “grey” might not include them.
It seems to me that preprints are such a big and important part of the landscape now that you can just portray the methodology as dealing with preprints rather than including grey literature.
Interesting debate as to whether preprints are grey literature, given that many of them are increasingly becoming findable in electronic bibliographic databases. We have no clear and widely used definition of grey literature.  -->

Given the evidence that this thesis produced on the usefulness of including preprints, normalisation of inclusion of preprints in systematic reviews. Wider assessment of the evidence base that exists solely as preprinted literature ()

Meta-epidemiological studies examining the factors which influence eventual publication would also help to quantify the extent and strength of publication bias


Preprints also represent a key opportunity to assess the impact of peer review on qualitative changes within

Future work should also address how to handle discrepancies between the preprinted and published versions of a paper, particularly if the results are subtantially different between the two versions.

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  
\newpage

### Evidence on vascular dementia

As discussed in an earlier section, there is an absence of evidence on vascular dementia across the evidence base

Future work should aim to address this evidence gap. 

large-scale GWAS of vascular dementia should be performed, to identify associated loci that future Mendelian randomisation studies can make use of. While this is methodologically challenging, given the difficult in diagnosing "pure" vascular dementia, it would be a worthwhile endeavour, and would allow for the assessment of many genetically driven risk factors beyond those considered in this thesis.

This is particularly relevant given that there was some evidence for an association of hypertriglyceraemia with vascular dementia. Future research should explicitly examine this relationship as part of wider exploration of vascular disease.

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  
\newpage

### Reviewing Mendelian randomisation studies

As noted in previous chapters, evidence synthesis theory and methods have not been sufficient developed for the inclusion of Mendelian randomisation studies.

A key issue arises from the lack of an established risk of bias tool, limiting future work that requires systematic risk-of-bias assessment, such as the triangulation framework presented in Chapter \@ref(hold). In addition, a lack of guidance around whether the inclusion of two-sample Mendelian randomisation studies using identical summary statistics. This was illustrated in detail in Chapter \@ref(4), where XXX studies using the same , and meta-analysing these as independent effect estimates would provide an overly precise result. Finally, future work should aim to validate search strategies for this study design, paying particular attention to the range of terms used to define it (e.g. genetic instrumental variable analysis).

Synthesis of Mendelian randomisation studies is not helped by the varied (and often poor) reporting, though the recent release of the STROBE-MR reporting guidelines should go someway to addressing this. 

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  
\newpage

### Empirical estimates of bias

Finally, substantial future work should be directed towards the conduct of meta-epidemiological studies to assess the impact of different bias in non-observational studies. While frameworks such as the one employed in Chapter \@ref(tri-heading) exist to allow for the production of bias-adjusted and triangulated estimates.

Finally, accounting for bias (and indirectness, if considering causal effects rather than a summary of the literature) is essentially in the interpretation of published literature. While this can take many forms, from the stratification of forest plots by overall risk of bias level, to the or to the more advance bias adjustment approach detailed here, it is insufficient to draw clinical recommendations from meta-analysis that treat effect estimates as if they were unbiased.
