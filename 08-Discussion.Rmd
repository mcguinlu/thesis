## Chapter overview

In this chapter I will summarise the principal findings from my thesis, 

assess the unique contributions of this thesis to the field of research, 

discuss the implications for both clinical and public health policy,

describe the overall strengths and limitations of this thesis as a whole, 

suggest avenues for impactful future research based on my findings and experiences. 

<!-- In this final chapter I will: -->
<!--  Summarise the main findings from each chapter in relation to my two thesis hypotheses. -->

<!--  Discuss the similarities and differences between my findings and the published literature. -->
<!--  Critically evaluate the novel contributions and implications of my research. -->
<!--  Describe the limitations of my studies and consider what I would do differently given what I have learnt. -->
<!--  Recommend avenues for future research. -->

## Summary of principal findings

Given the detailed discussion

## New evidence

Found slight raised risk of dementia in CPRD patients () with higher LDL-c measured at midlife, driven by the finding for Alzheimer's disease [@iwagami2021]. Not inconsistent with the findings presented in this thesis

## Overall strengths and limitations

This thesis has used multiple sources of evidence to examine the relationship between blood lipids levels and cholesterol risk. 

It has highlighted the importance of including preprints in systematic review, and provided a tool to enable researchers to easily do so. 

It has analysed two previously unanalysed datasets, adding useful information to the evidence base.

However, the thesis as a whole is subject to some strong limitations. 

There are several strengths and limitations to the work presented in this thesis. One particularly strength is the lengths gone to find all available published and unpublished evidence around the question, and to integrate this evidence in a coherent framework, taking into account the limitations of ach source and how these limitations may be used to provide 

Need for large simple trials for common disease where small treatment effect can have large effect - [@yusuf1984]


This thesis is limited by the low response rate to data access requests, and the

The lack of large, precise studies made comparison across different types of evidence difficult, while the low number of eligible studies for a

## Implications of this research

### Clinical practice

Across multiple sources of evidence, there was no consistent effect of blood lipids, or . Some 

The clinical recommendations that can be drawn from the work in this thesis are limited, due to the low strength of evidence related to the

There was very we. Conversely however, there was an absence of evidence for a harmful effect of statins on. Given the reality that given the choice, given the conflicting evidence 

Patients must live to a sufficient age to be at risk of dementia outcomes, which is substantially less like if high lipid levels in mid-life. 

The role of lipid-lowering 

As with many many studies of dementia outcomes, a key limiting factor of any analysis is the absence of a detailed pathological mechanism for Alzheimer's disease. It could well be that statins do have a true effect independently of lipid levels, though based on the certainty of evidence in NRSI, this is unlikely.

However, based on the available evidence 

For other dementia outcomes,

## Reproducible research

Reproducible and science has been a key theme running through this thesis, as reflected by the development of an open source tool to help search medRxiv and bioRxiv preprint metadata. In line with this, an open source copy of the code used to produce this thesis is available on GitHub, as is the code used to perform the analysis contained within it. 

<!-- TODO Could he get it work, could he feck. -->


Containerisation was used to ensure that the code is reproducible, in line iwht best practices

Commentary on the fact that the best you can do is replicate vs reproducible (due the closed nature of the data).

One is the ability to recreate the results given the same data and code, the other is the ability to recreate the results given the same code but a different dataset. IN theory it is possible to gain access the dataset given the information presented in Chapter \@(ref:cprd-analysis-heading). However, access is dependency on an ISAC application to the managing body of the CPRD.

## Public involvement and engagement {#disc-PPI}

Involving and engaging the public and patients has been a central theme to this thesis. 
Public engagement activities included 

Public involvement also steered the creation of the topic

## Future work

Several avenues for future research, buiding on the work presented here, 

###

### Inclusion of preprints

Normalisation of inclusion of preprints in systematic reviews. Wider assessment of the evidence base that exists solely as preprinted literature ()

Studying of factors which influence eventual publication would also help to identify the extent and strength of publication bias by providing a 

Preprints also represent a key oppportunity to assess the impact of peer review on qualitivative changes within

### Evidence on vascular dementia

As discussed, there is an absence of evidence on vascular dementia across the evidence base, potentially driven y

large-scale GWAS of vascular dementia should be performed, to identify associated loci that future Mendelian randomisation studies can make use of. While this is methodologically challenging, given the difficult in diagnosing "pure" vascular dementia, it would be a worthwhile endeavour, and would allow for the assessment of many genetically driven risk factors beyond those considered in this thesis.

 <!-- TODO See notes from Pat/Emma on this -->

&nbsp;<!----------------------------------------------------------------------->  

### Reviewing of Mendelian randomisation studies

As a field, and as noted in Chapter \@ref(sys-rev-heading-results), the evidence synthesis theory and methods have not been sufficient developed for Mendelian randomisation studies. Future work should aim to validate search strategies for this study design, paying particular attention to the range of terms used to define it (e.g. genetic instrumental variable analysis.)

Work is ongoing in this field, and new methodological work such as the release of teh MR-STROBE guidelines will aid in the future assessing by helping to improve the reporting of Mendelian randomisation studies. 

Problems with reporting of MR studies will hopefully

### Empirical estimates of bias

Finally, substantial future work should be directed towards the conduct of meta-epidemiological studies to assess the impact of different bias in non-observational studies. While frameworks such as the one employed in Chapter \@ref(tri-heading) exist to allow for the production of bias-adjusted and triangulated estimates.

### Imporved analytical designs

Use of the real-world evidence approach needs to be traded off against the important limitations that t

Talk about the problems with real world evidence, and highlight that even when using these techniques, you still don't get the correct answers.
