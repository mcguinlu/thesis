## Critical Top 10 Questions

* This paper includes additional information - why not extracted?

* Why did you not include CFAS as one of the approached cohorts?

* What criteria are you using to define the outcomes in the systematic review? Why not consistent?

- Can you explain the method used to examine the shape of the relationship? e.g. splines, etc.

## General 

* Can you explain what you mean by this sentence?

* What does this figure tell us?

## Common

* Can you start by summarising your thesis?



* Now, can you summarise it in one sentence?

Using new and existing evidence to examine the relationship between blood lipids and incident dementia.

* What is the idea that binds your thesis together?

    * We need to be able to find and combine **all** available evidence to get the best picture of a research question.
    * We need new open source tools to help us do this

* What is the point? Would money not be better spent else-where?

    * Utilising existing evidence is a great money-saver, both in terms of making use of previously-funded work and by ensuring that future work actually addresses research gaps rather than re-hashing existing work.

* **What motivated and inspired you to carry out this research?**

    * Interesting cross-section between two methods . I firmly believe that , and dementia, as an underfunded but incredibly important

* **What are the main issues and debates in this subject area?**

    * Validity of combining across data sources

    * Validity/purity of dementia diagnoses, particularly artributed to sub-type (Carol - EHR code list validation study)

* **Which of these does your research address?**


* **Why is the problem you have tackled worth tackling?**

    * Important to ensure that obs evidence can be used.

* **Who has had the strongest influence in the development of your subject area in theory and practice?**



* **Which are the three most important papers that relate to your thesis?**

    * Bias adjustment, Turner et al. With out, there would be no Chapter 7








* **What published work is closest to yours? How is your work different?**

<!-- TODO Need to read-up on history of bias adjustment and how I could have approached it differently -->

* Previous work is based on Turner's paper. The key difference is that that paper used expert elictation with knowledge of the results to specify the level of bias adjustment.

* **What do you know about the history of [insert something relevant]?**



* **How does your work relate to [insert something relevant]?**


* **What are the most recent major developments in your area?**

    * For preprint searching, the indexing of preprint servers by recognised databases.

    * For systematic reviews - 

    * For triangulation - 

* **How did your research questions emerge?**



* What were the crucial research decisions you made?



* Why did you use this research methodology? What did you gain from it?



* What were the alternatives to this methodology?



* What would you have gained by using another approach?



* How did you deal with the ethical implications of your work?



* **How has your view of your research topic changed?**


* **How have you evaluated your work?**

    * Used negative controls/multiple reviewers/piloting/comparison across multiple evidence sources

    * Use of secondary reviewers, and peer-review where possible. 

    * Making everything open on point of publication, so that it can be evaluated by the community.

* **How do you know that your findings are correct?**

    * Hard to know for sure that they results are accurate.

    * But I have tried where possible to ensure experimental controls were used to confirm my results. For example:

        * _CPRD:_ use of negative controls to confirm the presence of confounding by indication.
        * _SR:_ use of inter-rater agreement
        * _Tri:_ use of sensitivity analyses using different prior distributions of bias to assess whether the results

    * In addition, risk of bias assessment is an inherently subjective process - different reviewers bring different experiences. In addition, the assessment of the direction of bias, as in Chapter 7, is particularly challenging.

* **What are the strongest/weakest parts of your work?**

    * Strenghts

        * Combination of different evidence sources in search of the best possible answer to my research question
        * Production of new evidence, both from unanalysed cohorts and on understudied outcome (vascular dementia)
        * Development of new methodologies and tools to support my research, which have been used extensively beyond this 

    * Weakness
    
        * Lack of well-defined pathological mechanism - common to all studies of dementia
        * Use of secondary data sources
        * Presence of missing evidence
        * Geographical focus

* **What would have improved your work?**

    * Increased access to data availability as part of the 

* **To what extent do your contributions generalise?**

    * Problems with generalisation of using the prior distributions based on the data from Turner _et al_
    * More generally, geographical focus of the evidence included in the stud

* **Who will be most interested in your work?**

    * Clinicans - should be aware of the existing uncertainty around lipids/statins and be prepared to communicate this to concerned patients.

    * Methodologists - methods proposed (searching preprints/incorporating bias into a systematic review/triangulating across evidence sources) could/should be used across different domains.

* **What is the relevance of your work to other researchers?**

    * See methodologist response above.

* **What is the relevance of your work to practitioners?**

    * 



* **Which aspects of your work do you intend to publish – and where?**

    * Chapter 2 is published - Journal of Open Source Software
    * Chapter 5 is available from medRxiv and under consideration at International Journal of Epidemiology.
    * Chapter 6 - probably won't publish.
    * Chapter 7 - plan is to combine it with the systematic review and publish as a case study of the new tool.


* **Summarise your key findings.**

    * No consistent effect of any examined blood lipid fraction on any dementia outcome.

    * Published NRSI give protective effect of statins, but didn't replicate when combined with other evidence, suggesting the presence of bias in these studies.

    * Absence of evidence on vascular dementia outcome

* **Which of these findings are the most interesting to you? Why?**

    * Conflict with existing reviews of NRSI-only. Suggests strong publication bias at play, and methodological issues explaing obeserved protective effect. 

    * Similar to what you Carol found in 2010 systematic review for the Alzheimer's Society Vascular Dementia Systematic Review Group


* **How do your findings relate to literature in your field?**

    * Note discrepancy with previous reviews of NRSI only.
    * Large scale CPRD study of blood lipids found increased risk of AD with increased lipids, but sensitivity found it could be explained by ApoE4
    * UK BioBank study similarly found no association with lipids at mid-life, but also didn't have ApoE4.


* **What are the contributions to knowledge of your thesis?**



* **How long-term are these contributions?**



* **What are the main achievements of your research?**



* **What have you learned from the process of doing your PhD?**

    * See learning points in Appendix

* **What advice would you give to a research student entering this area?**

    * Make time for methods development
    
    * Find your community. - got in with ES Hackathon crowd, which enable a lot of the most impactful work.

* **You propose future research. How would you start this?**

    1. Long-term follow-up on existing RCTs, via EHR linkage
    1. Focused studies of vascular dementia
    1. Better guidance for MR studies in systematic reviews
        * How to deal with multiple counting?
        * Dedicated risk-of-bias tool.
    1. Inclusion of meta-biases (e.g. missing evidence)
    1. Design of studies known to be at risk of conflicting bias to the existing literature.

* **What would be the difficulties?**

    1. Loss to follow-up could be different between randomised groups
    1. Problems defining a "pure" VaD outcome
    1. ROB-ME is a very new tool, and assessing bias due to missing evidence is also new. Problems could arise in terms of adoption.

* **What have you done that merits a PhD?**

    * New framework for integrating the results of several diverse sources of evidence in a formal manner, using evidence synthesis methods.
    * Applied this method to a pressing research question, assessing the prevention of dementia via a readily modifiable risk factor.
    * Additionally, created open source tools to ensure that the methodological developments can be used by my peers.

* **If you were to do the project again would you do anything differently?**

    * Be less ambitious when planning the project.
    * Spend less time on the individual patient data analysis, and more on the methodological work around triangulation.

## Chapter 1 - Background

* **What are the differences between the NINCDS-AIREN/ADRA?**

* **Explain how the different lipid-lowering treatments work?**

    * General overview is given in Table 1.4

    * Statins inhibit biosynthesis of cholesterol (Figure 1.1)
    * Ezetimibe - inhibits absorption of cholesterol from food
    * Fibrates - reduce production of TG compounds in the liver
    * PCSK9i - prevent PCSK9 from removing LDL-c receptors on the liver, increasing uptake/degradation

## Chapter 2 - `medrxivr`


<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Chapter 4 - Systematic review methods

* **Why not use GRADE?**

    * Essentially using GRADE via triangulation approach.

* **There are limitations to including preprints - discuss?**

* **Problem with eligibility criteria**

    * Eligible studies defined dementia outcomes using an objective process, incorporating recognised criteria. - What does this mean? I had originally stated that I would include only studies that defined dementia using specific criteria. This was hard to operationalise as often the criteria are not specified, but clear from other information (case note review) that clinicans likely followed these criteria.

    * Say that HPS didn't report methods used, but likely to be eligible because of the process used to define dementia.

* **Reason/limitation for using filters?**

    * Confirmed they weren't excluding anything obviously relevant by 

* **How was Mendelian randomisation filter designed?**



Not looking at results of Chi-sq test for heterogeneity, as argue that het will always be present and it is the extent of it that matters!

## Chapter 4 - Systematic review results

* **Lots of studies assessed at high risk of bias for selection into the study - why?**

* **What are the domains of the [X] tool?**

* **Can you explain how the ROB-ME tool works?**

* **Talk about problems with including Hippsley-Cox re double-counting?**

WHY OKAY TO INCLUDE ehr WHEN NOT USING CRITERIA? NOT COLLECTED FOR REASEARCH AND SO POTENTIALLY LESS LIKELY TO HAVE DIFFERENTIAL MISCLASSIFICATION

## Chapter 5 - CPRD

* **It would be very rare to start someone on 2 drugs at the same time.**

    * This is true, and we can see from the flow diagram that it is v rare. Only XXX people




* **Less clear why chronic illness would predict statin use**

    * 

* **The flowchart for defining dementia diagnoses seems to ignore the ordering. So if the initial diagnosis was VaD but later it was changed to AD it is coded as “Other dementia” but actual evidence might have switched it to AD. This can be criticized.**

    * A more complicated coding scheme/algorithm could have bee


* **Was age considered as a continuous variable e.g. 65.8 years? Did you check for linear assumption and look at either age grouped or polynomial?**

    * Age was included as the time axis in the 

    * Did not accou

Not sure I follow this. Are you assuming that as the diagnosis of AD has become more popular there would not only be an increase in frequency but I shift towards more probable or perhaps more possible if lower threshold. Please clarify. - _Thinking is that_

Did you formally test for heterogeneity between lipophilic and hydrophilic statins?

Why did you not use a trial emulation analysis? See emails for reasons to justify.

* **Would confounding effect of ApoE4 not be somewhat moderated by adjusting for LDL-c?**

    * Only if effect of ApoE is mediated by it's effect on LDL-c. If there is an independent mechanism, then 

* **Increased risk of AD with fibrates?**

    * Not consistent across AD outcomes like ezetimibe is across vascular/other

Which method did you use for random effects meta-analysis and why?

Why is the dose response model multi-variate? Accounts for results and the correlation between results.

What is the purpose of using knots?



* **Why is the std error of LDL much wider than others?**

    * Needed to be calculated from the imputed values of TC, HDL and TG, and so more variability across the different datasets.

What are unique contributions above and beyond Becky's work? A priori assignment of bias distributions, using of cutting edge tools to assess bias and mapping of answers to additive/proportional biases, new visualisations of bias, multiple sources of evidence, broader definition of indirect (e.g. using statins as a source of evidence on an exposure).



Why not use a multivariate approach, given co-dependence of all lipid fractions?



Did you adjust for clustering in the CPRD analysis?

Interpretation of difference in lipid properties - Could frame this as providing evidence that the effect is not due to statins acting on lipid levels, as then would not expect difference (unless all very hard acting statins are in the lipophilic type)

Ordering of the dementia codes is not important - need to deal with the fact that the ordering is not accounted for, which could be critised 

Why male and female for pregnancy analysis?

Why does severe codelist cause inflated HR?

    * Maybe have extra figure for this

## Chapter 6 - Individual patient data analysis

* Thoughts on open data access - Carol has written a lot on this.

* How did you choose cut-off points?

    * Based on National Cholesterol Education Programme criteria (Table 1.2)

* How did you decide on which underlying cohorts to approach?

## Chapter 7 - Triangulation

* **Why are prior distiburitons defined on the log-scale?**
